<p><strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> is the 8th and most recent installment in the RE series. It is a first person action survival horror game where you play as Ethan Winters, lost in a remote and ancient village somewhere in the Romanian countryside, trying to get back his daughter, Rose. The game starts with her and you being kidnapped and you waking up in the woods after the car of the kidnappers crashes. You then find yourself in a village watched over by strange beings, trying to find the answer to where Rose is.
<br/></p>
<p>I will preface <strong>the good parts</strong> with the fact that I am usually not a fan of horror especially by myself, Dead Space being kind of the limit of spooky that I’m willing to go to. That being said, this game blew me out of the water. This game toed the line between action and horror perfectly. I always felt like I was in control (except that 1 time in the dollhouse), that I could defend myself, and that if I died it was because I missed crucial shots and not because of a weird gimmick or something unexpected. Enemies are properly introduced and you get a good feel for the limits of your weapons and how to approach each situation. 
<br/></p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, they absolutely nailed the spooky atmosphere of an abandoned village in the middle of nowhere. Even in broad daylight I was on my toes thanks to the music, the world design, the sound effects and the constant ominous feeling looming over you that something awful was going to happen. This meant the game didn't really have to resort to cheap jump scares to keep you frightened. It helped that the game is super detailed and the textures are fantastic leading to a very realistic setting and believable world. <br/>
<strong>Thirdly</strong>, the combat had weight. Every bullet mattered, no matter from which gun it was shot. They had appropriate impact, they felt good to use, and I was surprised at the amount of guns we got to use (around 8 I believe). On the flipside the enemies were all very cool and scary in their own right. There was a good balance of ammos / tools to enemies as well, meaning I wasn't afraid to use all my tools but also making sure none were wasted.<br/>
<strong>The fourth great thing</strong> about this game was the exploration and map. I love a good map that tells me when I found everything that could be found in every room I explored. It made said exploration rewarding without dragging on cause I knew there was nothing left to find.<br/>
<strong>The fifth great thing</strong> was the bosses. The game is quite distinctly separated in 5 zones each with their own atmosphere and boss that is super unique. Each one has an awesome fight that represented them well and an area that represented totally different types of horror.<br/>
<strong>The last great thing</strong> about this game are the characters. They might not get much dialogue but most were really fleshed out and had a great personality (like Lady D.). I loved the Duke (the merchant) a lot and Heisenberg too.<br/>
Honestly I couldn't find much I didn’t enjoy about this game except the fact our protagonist Ethan is so dumb and has the worst one-liners evers, but it's also kind of funny at the same time.<br/><br/>
<strong>Overall</strong>, I give RE: Village my first 10 /10 of the year. I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed this game. I was looking forward to playing it every day. It was super engaging and there were always new elements being introduced to shake things up. The fighting was awesome. The atmosphere was superb. The setting and world were gorgeous. The sound design was just perfect (ok maybe picking items was a little too dramatic but otherwise it was good). The boss fights were fantastic and fun. The story was simple and straightforward. The characters were well thought out. Exploring was great. The horror was well built in. Just an overall amazing experience that was well paced and just the right length. Would recommend. Play time: 20 hours (finding every item possible).</p>
