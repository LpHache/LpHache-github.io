<p>Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder game that is quite fantastic. You are an envoy from the Smoldering City, a town at the center of the map that is the only place that doesn't get destroyed by the Blightstorm. The Blightstorm is a terrible event that wipes out the entire map after a certain amount of time, including all settlements you made and the map layout (this is what defines an entire AtS run). In between storms you venture out to make settlements that will gather resources for the city (permanent upgrades to your runs) if they succeed, and bring you closer to fixing broken seals that are far away from the city(the objective of each run, fixing increasingly harder seals). A successful seal fixing will increase the time between storms, allowing you to venture further out to the harder seals. <br/><br/>
Now each settlement you make will be completely different, it's hard to explain every game mechanic here as there are so many, but you have to reach 14 victory points before you reach 14 impatience points and lose. You will have access to different buildings every run (can’t rely on one in particular) and get access to new ones at set victory point levels. You get cornerstone choices to give bonuses as well that will be different each time. Your city will always have 3 of 5 possible races of villagers. Each one has different housing needs, complex food needs, and service needs to be happy. Very happy villagers will give you victory points so you want to fulfill as much as you can. However the forest isn’t happy you are there, there are dangerous and forbidden glades all around you that have events in them. Solving them in time with the proper ressources will give you bonuses but if you can’t finish it, you’ll end up with huge negative modifiers. There’s also a storm every 8 in-game minutes that will give huge debuffs to all your villagers and when they are too unhappy they will start leaving in droves, increasing the impatience and making it harder to run all the buildings in your settlement. It's all a very big balancing act to win your settlement and move on to the next to reach the seals.<br/></p>
<p><strong>++++ Extremely engaging and varied gameplay.</strong> This game is crazy fun, you take the frostpunk concept of keeping a city alive in adverse conditions and shove it into a repeatable roguelite shell and wow you get this game. Each settlement is so different with buildings, cornerstones, queen’s orders, races, biomes, soil,  traders, events encountered and more. Yes you build a city every run but they are never close to the same. <br/></p>
<p><strong>++++ Ton of strategy and planning involved.</strong> You need to deal with map modifiers. You need to keep track of fuel for your hearths by cutting wood or gathering coal. You need to pump out planks, bricks and fabrics as building materials to build homes and complex shelters. You need to set up farms and gathering camps to keep up with the food demand and start making complex foods using those basics like pies, porridge, skewers and more. You need to get service buildings like Taverns, temples, and bathhouses to please the different races of your city and supply those with ale, tea, incense, etc to satisfy everyone’s needs. You need to pack provisions and goods in boxes to trade them with other cities and traders to make money to buy out stuff you can produce. You need to manage how angry the forest is at you and all the negative effects with cornerstones or upgrading your Hearths. You need to manage your collected rainwater to run your rainpunk engines that increase production. You need to manage the Blightrot spawning and corrupting your hearths. Every new villager means more mouths to feed, more housing required but also more hands to get to work. If you don't do even 1 of the things above, your town might fail and people will start leaving.  It’s extremely satisfying to get a good settlement rolling and producing everything.<br/></p>
<p><strong>++++ Meaningful upgrades and rewards.</strong> After almost every settlement you can go to the main city and upgrade something like better starting ressources, more trade routes, better prices and so much more. Always make you look forward to the next run with your upgrade.<br/></p>
<p><strong>+++ Performs very well.</strong> This game opens and loads into your game in about 10 seconds flat. It's insane. Makes it so easy to just load in real quick for even just a few minutes anytime you want. Runs super well on x3 speed, never had any issues or bugs.<br/></p>
<p><strong>+++ Good sound design.</strong> Important audio cues tell you when something needs your attention at all times. Nice little background music as well.<br/></p>
<p><strong>+++ Super customizable difficulty.</strong> You have 4 basic difficulties that change a few major things. You can play with those as much as you want but each new seal demands a higher difficulty. The first three need to be beat at normal, hard and very hard respectively. Then there are 20 prestige levels and every single one makes one aspect significantly harder (costlier rerolls, longer storms, harder orders, more expensive buildings, etc) that need to be beaten in order to unlock the next. And the last 4 seals need to be beat at prestige 5, 10, 15 and 20 to beat the whole game. (I stopped at prestige 5)<br/></p>
<p><strong>++ Cool biomes.</strong> There are 6 different biomes each with their different modifiers and unique ways of playing on them. Really loved switching around which biome I'd build in.<br/></p>
<p><strong>- The game can be long to finish (if you care about finishing things).</strong> At 120h, I still have about half the game left if I want to complete all upgrades and beat all the challenges, and that's with only 1 failed prestige 5 run. Each town at x3 speed can be up to 30-35mins long (without pausing, which you do A LOT of) and you’ll have to make 5-7 towns before reaching a seal and restarting a new run. (But it's also really fun to do all of that so is it really that bad?) (and tbf, stopping after any seal you completed is also a super valid thing to do)<br/></p>
<p><strong>- I want more biomes, and just more of everything.</strong> Visually it can be a bit samey at times with the forest and glades all looking alike, so I wish there was a bigger variety of in game areas to play around with.</p></p>
