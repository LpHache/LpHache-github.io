<p><strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> is an action-adventure game set in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. You start the game as a new fifth year student joining the school for the first time. You quickly discover you have a rare ability to see and wield forms of ancient magic others cannot, and that an evil is seeking you out for being involved in his affairs. You spend the game going to classes and learning new spells and potions, all the while investigating ancient magic through the help of some old professors and defending the Hogwarts valley.<br/></p>
<h4 id="the-good"><strong>The Good</strong></h4>
<p><strong>++++ Dynamic combat.</strong> Despite some people finding it a bit repetitive, I thought the combat was one of the strong points of the game. You eventually have over 20 different spells you can use with many of them having combos with each other such as: exploding a frozen enemy, smashing down a levitating enemy, or even turning enemies into explosive barrels and yeeting them at enemies (my favorite). Almost all enemies had specific weaknesses to look out for as well that helped stun them and leave them vulnerable, like flipping a troll club back on its head, levitating toads by their tongue when they try to lash at you, or interrupting enemy spell casts so it blows up in their face. On top of the spells, you had half a dozen potions and a few plants you could use during combat to mix things up. Each combat has bonus objectives as well that gave hints to enemy weaknesses and encouraged using different tools and consumables during fights which was nice. All of this led to a well rounded and interesting combat experience. I only wish the "basic cast" was a bit more interesting.<br/>
<strong>++++ The castle is insane.</strong> Hogwarts is done in such beautiful detail. I loved exploring every little hallway and solving all the puzzles and secrets I could find. You could tell a lot of love went into designing this location and its the highlight of the game as a Harry Potter fan. Lots of students within and in class try to get you mixed in with their shenanigans (Weasley).<br/>
<strong>++++ The Room of Requirements was a great idea.</strong> To help catch up with your studies, you are given access to the RoR which transforms into your little home base with loads of customization. You can transform every wall, ceiling, floor to make the decor you prefer and add countless decorations to your liking from lamps, tables, shevles, paintings, statues and much more. The decoration tools are advanced and well detailed and any base building fan will feel right at home. Beyond being pretty, it also serves to add all your utility stations. You can put down potion tables for brewing, growing pots to grow your combat plants, and stations to upgrade your armor.<br/>
<strong>++++ Beasts are cute as hell.</strong> You can rescue beasts from poachers, and the RoR evolves to make some vivarium's for your beasts to roam free which is insane. You get to pet them and feed them and build homes and its cute and you get materials and you can even breed them and get cute babies. I really enjoyed rescuing a bunch of beasts and building a collection.<br/>
<strong>+++ Attending classes is fun.</strong> You get to attend every class at least once where you usually learn something new and really live that student life. It takes you around the castle and usually there's a little class montage that happens. Its authentic and a lot of people wished this section was more developed but for this type of game I think it struck a good balance. Felt like the early HP movies.<br/>
<strong>+++ Large world to explore.</strong> The map outside of Hogwarts is actually huge. There is lot's of exploring if thats you thing, and can be fun for a while. Filled with activities such as: Rescuing beasts, clearing poacher / goblin camps, Merlin puzzles, treasure caves, astronomy tables, broom flying trials, and more.<br/>
<strong>+++ The story was better than I thought.</strong> A lot of disappointement online had to do with the story. I found it to be interesting and progressed nicely. I do think there were some pacing problems but otherwise it had a lot of good moments even if it was a little predictable. Mostly that each part barely held any new information or twists.<br/>
<strong>+++ Solid side quests.</strong> There were 3 main companion quest lines that were really interesting, even more than the main story. Few other ones on the map were good as well, like the haunted chest. Too bad its hard to say before doing it if its a boring fetch quest or a good one.<br/>
<strong>++ Seasons changing is nice.</strong> As you progress the main story the seasons change which make the world feel well alive and gives a good sense of progression in time.<br/>
<strong>++ Broom and mounts are cool additions.</strong> While there might not be quidditch, you do get to fly around the world on your broom and I found it to be a fun way to get around. You also get a hippogriff mount which is obviously cool.<br/></p>
<h4 id="the-bad"><strong>The Bad</strong></h4>
<p><strong>- Low action at times.</strong> Understandable as a student though, as the castle isn't under siege. It did mean that most of the action happened outside Hogwarts, away from the cool castle.<br/>
<strong>- A bit long to unlock everything.</strong> I think an issue here is they actually show you all the locked spells right from the start. So it's all very predictable but takes a while to unlock all. Then it gets a bit stale when you get the last spell since you know there won't be anything new. I wish the unlocks had remained hidden.<br/>
<strong>- Bad altered voice.</strong> Took a deeper voice than default, clearly was just a bad digital filter on it. Was sad.<br/>
<strong>-- Holding button for actions suck.</strong> Seriously stop asking me to hold A for 5 seconds to close menus, open chests, or do anything. Just click once. Please.<br/>
<strong>-- Bit of dissonance between being a student, but also murdering people.</strong> Its very weird to be basically a high school yet continuously murdering other wizards. Even if they are "bad people" such as poachers and kidnappers. Its weird for teachers and adults to not seriously ask wtf is wrong with you or jail you for these crimes. Don't get me started on the absolute lack of consequences for using unforgiveable curses willy nilly as if they were no worse than expelliarmus.<br/>
<strong>-- The equipment / armor systems felt underdeveloped.</strong> The armor grind was kind of annoying for the first 50% of the game. You were always just stat swapping with nothing interesting. It got better when you unlocked the magic loom and the possibility to enchant things though. You could transmog, but it only stuck to the item and not the slot, so you had to reapply every time. Equipment only stats against enemies that pretty much always matched your level felt kind of pointless though. I understand it helped tie in the beasts for upgrades but i wish the system did more, or simply was removed.<br/>
<strong>-- Map too big, with underwhelming rewards.</strong> As fun as the open world was for a while, in the 3rd act you reach a new zone, and it is massive. The open world activities have gotten old by that point and the thought of having to explore this area was daunting, even for me. The biome was more interesting, but I was sick of the same trials and just sped through the story by then. It also sucks that most rewards are armor pieces that suck more than what you have equipped. There are no cool weapons to find or spells.<br/>
<strong>-- Wasted Characters</strong>. All the cool and fleshed out students and friends from companions' quests basically don't exist outside of their story which is a shame. Wish the game had done more with the characters it had. Perhaps interactions with the main story, an effect on the ending, meeting them around school and such.<br/>
<strong>--- I had the worst damn stutter.</strong> I had this weird thing were I got a frame drop every time I cast a spell. It was annoying as hell and made combat super jumpy and hard. Might be my setup that sucked though, didn't always happen.<br/></p></p>
