The puzzles revolve around round orbs you can carry around but also enter, as each orb is its own world you can explore. ++++ Clever and fun puzzles. The orb-worlds are so fun to play around with. You can dive into the orb you carry at fixed points and get more worlds. You can store worlds within each other to carry them all around. It's a really unique system that I haven\u2019t really seen before. Although it might seem confusing and complex at first, the game does a good job explaining exactly how everything works and leaving little room for error. I never got stuck more than a few minutes on any particular puzzle. ++++ Beautiful art style and good animations. The game just looks gorgeous and the worlds are all very distinct and pretty. The animations were natural and seamless, all the moving parts looked really well done. +++ Mysterious world and story. While you won\u2019t get much story in this game, the ending was very interesting, and the visual storytelling is great. It\u2019s an interesting world for sure. ++ Good soundtrack and sound design. Just satisfying clicks and boops. Whimsical tunes. ++ Neat little bosses. Highlighted gameplay progression and were nice in breaking the pace of solving puzzles a bit. They weren\u2019t very hard. ++ Casual controls. Only WASD needed and 1 action button. There's no fighting per se (outside of 4 bosses fights, which work with evading attacks and using the action button) and there are no puzzles that demand timing skills or weird series of commands. ++ Perfect length. Makes for a nice palate cleanser game.

Check a guide or just pay a little attention in game and you shouldn\u2019t have a problem with it. -- No backtracking.

You are an envoy from the Smoldering City, a town at the center of the map that is the only place that doesn't get destroyed by the Blightstorm. The Blightstorm is a terrible event that wipes out the entire map after a certain amount of time, including all settlements you made and the map layout (this is what defines an entire AtS run). In between storms you venture out to make settlements that will gather resources for the city (permanent upgrades to your runs) if they succeed, and bring you closer to fixing broken seals that are far away from the city(the objective of each run, fixing increasingly harder seals). A successful seal fixing will increase the time between storms, allowing you to venture further out to the harder seals. Now each settlement you make will be completely different, it's hard to explain every game mechanic here as there are so many, but you have to reach 14 victory points before you reach 14 impatience points and lose. You will have access to different buildings every run (can\u2019t rely on one in particular) and get access to new ones at set victory point levels. You get cornerstone choices to give bonuses as well that will be different each time. Your city will always have 3 of 5 possible races of villagers. Each one has different housing needs, complex food needs, and service needs to be happy. Very happy villagers will give you victory points so you want to fulfill as much as you can. However the forest isn\u2019t happy you are there, there are dangerous and forbidden glades all around you that have events in them. Solving them in time with the proper ressources will give you bonuses but if you can\u2019t finish it, you\u2019ll end up with huge negative modifiers. There\u2019s also a storm every 8 in-game minutes that will give huge debuffs to all your villagers and when they are too unhappy they will start leaving in droves, increasing the impatience and making it harder to run all the buildings in your settlement. It's all a very big balancing act to win your settlement and move on to the next to reach the seals. ++++ Extremely engaging and varied gameplay. This game is crazy fun, you take the frostpunk concept of keeping a city alive in adverse conditions and shove it into a repeatable roguelite shell and wow you get this game. Each settlement is so different with buildings, cornerstones, queen\u2019s orders, races, biomes, soil, traders, events encountered and more. Yes you build a city every run but they are never close to the same. ++++ Ton of strategy and planning involved. You need to deal with map modifiers. You need to keep track of fuel for your hearths by cutting wood or gathering coal. You need to pump out planks, bricks and fabrics as building materials to build homes and complex shelters. You need to set up farms and gathering camps to keep up with the food demand and start making complex foods using those basics like pies, porridge, skewers and more. You need to get service buildings like Taverns, temples, and bathhouses to please the different races of your city and supply those with ale, tea, incense, etc to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs. You need to pack provisions and goods in boxes to trade them with other cities and traders to make money to buy out stuff you can produce. You need to manage how angry the forest is at you and all the negative effects with cornerstones or upgrading your Hearths. You need to manage your collected rainwater to run your rainpunk engines that increase production. You need to manage the Blightrot spawning and corrupting your hearths. Every new villager means more mouths to feed, more housing required but also more hands to get to work. If you don't do even 1 of the things above, your town might fail and people will start leaving. It\u2019s extremely satisfying to get a good settlement rolling and producing everything. ++++ Meaningful upgrades and rewards. After almost every settlement you can go to the main city and upgrade something like better starting ressources, more trade routes, better prices and so much more. Always make you look forward to the next run with your upgrade. +++ Performs very well. This game opens and loads into your game in about 10 seconds flat. It's insane. Makes it so easy to just load in real quick for even just a few minutes anytime you want. Runs super well on x3 speed, never had any issues or bugs. +++ Good sound design. Important audio cues tell you when something needs your attention at all times. Nice little background music as well. +++ Super customizable difficulty. You have 4 basic difficulties that change a few major things. You can play with those as much as you want but each new seal demands a higher difficulty. The first three need to be beat at normal, hard and very hard respectively. Then there are 20 prestige levels and every single one makes one aspect significantly harder (costlier rerolls, longer storms, harder orders, more expensive buildings, etc) that need to be beaten in order to unlock the next. And the last 4 seals need to be beat at prestige 5, 10, 15 and 20 to beat the whole game. (I stopped at prestige 5) ++ Cool biomes. There are 6 different biomes each with their different modifiers and unique ways of playing on them. Really loved switching around which biome I'd build in. - The game can be long to finish (if you care about finishing things). At 120h, I still have about half the game left if I want to complete all upgrades and beat all the challenges, and that's with only 1 failed prestige 5 run. Each town at x3 speed can be up to 30-35mins long (without pausing, which you do A LOT of) and you\u2019ll have to make 5-7 towns before reaching a seal and restarting a new run. (But it's also really fun to do all of that so is it really that bad?) (and tbf, stopping after any seal you completed is also a super valid thing to do) - I want more biomes, and just more of everything. Visually it can be a bit samey at times with the forest and glades all looking alike, so I wish there was a bigger variety of in game areas to play around with.","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#against-the-storm","text":"","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#score-9510","text":"","title":"Score: 9.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#playtime-120-hours","text":"Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder game that is quite fantastic.

It was missing a little oomph. -- The story was forgettable. Sadly, the main story was pretty bland. MC is inhabited by a friendly ghost hunter and given powers. Chases the main bad guy around because he took his sister. Most quests involve fetching Macguffins that will allow us to reach him, or looking for old partners / clues of your spirit friend. No super well crafted main missions unfortunately. - Too much rain. Really held the graphics back when trying to render heavy rain during half the game. woulda been nicer without it (even if the atmosphere would take a small hit).","title":"Playtime: 20 hours"},{"location":"reviews/haloinfinite/","text":"Halo Infinite (Campaign) Score: 8/10 Playtime: 35 hours Halo Infinite is the latest installment of the Halo series. You once again follow Master Chief after a sudden attack on a UNSC spaceship where he finds himself on a broken ring The Banished (brutes) are trying to repair. You make it your mission to rescue your crew and stop The Banished at all costs. ++++ Great Halo combat. This is another home run for great Halo gameplay. The weapons are fun and responsive, the fights are challenging, and you often get the usual suite of cool Halo vehicles to mow down your opponents with. The grappling hook to throw bombs and quickly reposition was great as well. Few other gadgets like shield wall, dash, and sensor kept things interesting too. ++++ Sweet new weapons. The Hydra (Explosive guided rounds) was a blast to use, commando (LMG) was fun as well as the Shock rifle (stuns) and Skewer (grunt sniper). They also added weapons variants for ALL weapons that modified their stats and use (Like a shorter range sniper with more ammo and a gap-closing Gravity hammer). +++ The open world wasn\u2019t too bloated. What I mean is that there weren\u2019t dozens of pointless badly written sidequests in this game. Yes, there were Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) to capture a lot, but those were basically fast travel points and areas to spawn vehicles / the loadout you wanted. So they felt good to capture. The rest were all optional easy to do stuff like rescue spartans, find some cores (upgrade component for your skills), assassinate special grunt targets (to unlock their variant weapon) and a few bases to sabotage. Good little objectives that made sense to do and rewarded you all with points to unlocked better loadouts at FOBs. Also fully optional (missions are fast travel points too, don\u2019t even need FOBs). +++ Decent story. It isn\u2019t really as grand or epic as other entries in the stories, but it's a lot more personal. You get a lot of character development about Chief as a human that I really liked as he explores his feelings a little deeper beyond what we usually see. The story of the banished is interesting as yell even if they do too many monologues. ++ Good soundtrack and sound design. Halo soundtrack is always a banger, and continues this trend here. Where the main theme hits you can\u2019t help but feel hyped. Of course they remix it a bit every time and it's not my favorite iteration, it's still good. Sound design of guns and enemies is always top notch as well. Grunt headshots, sniper sounds, vehicle sounds, all classics. --- It's a great FPS game with a Halo skin, but it\u2019s not a good HALO campaign. What I mean is that usually Halo campaigns are more well crafted. They are epic set pieces and each mission has a goal and you\u2019re going to a bunch of different places. You have a certain sense of scale with the UNSC armies and all the leaders you talk to. You have the good intro missions, the stealth missions with snipers, the Scorpion tank mission where you blast through shit, the sick final where you take down a big bad or run away from explosions. That\u2019s what makes a good Halo campaign. This game has none of that. The missions all happen in the same biome or within forerunner structures. Because of the open world, they just feel like bigger \u201ctake down this outpost\u201d activities instead of proper missions. You also spend way too much time traversing the same 4 hallways for like half the game walking through the same interior structures forever. It's also a very lonely game. You only have the AI and 1 soldier you talk to for the whole game and that's it. While it helped with the chief's character, it was a bit bland. -- Singular location got old fast. As mentioned above, the open world being a single biome got pretty boring. Same landscape the whole game, and even worse inside structures. Wish that it had been different. - A few notable omissions.** Any weapon on demand and they don\u2019t include the spartan laser? C\u2019mon man that\u2019s the most fun one. Also no fuel rod launcher, and no enemy Scarab tanks to take down.","title":"Halo Infinite"},{"location":"reviews/haloinfinite/#halo-infinite-campaign","text":"","title":"Halo Infinite (Campaign)"},{"location":"reviews/haloinfinite/#score-810","text":"","title":"Score: 8/10"},{"location":"reviews/haloinfinite/#playtime-35-hours","text":"Halo Infinite is the latest installment of the Halo series.

It has a very classic feel, very large maps with tons of secrets, bosses, enemies and the like. Its quite a fun action game and I'm happy I got to play it. There isn't much platforming (such as spike pits, spike wall, flying through tight spaces, etC) and focuses much more on combat and abilities to discover hidden areas. ++++ Looks fantastic. The game is gorgeous, easily its strongest point to me. The envrionments look very good and so do the enemies. Cutscenes are give or take but considering it's a Switch game theres only so much to do there. ++++ Map design is so good. Despite having 6 very large maps with hundreds of path, the game made sure the envrionments and configurations changed at every major point tonicely lead the player in the right direction. While some people enjoy the puzzle aspects of these types of games, where you have to search or remember which area was blocked that can now be opened, Dread is surprisingly linear. I appreciated that as getting lost and not knowing where to go is usually a big turn off for me. +++ Great progression with cool abilities. Every time I picked up the game, I managed to find at least an upgrade for my suit within a session. Getting new rockets, new suit resists, new bombs, etc. These help change up the gameplay and always open up new paths to keep you going. ++ Interesting boss battles. The major bosses encountered really pushed me to make use of all the abilities I had so far and were nice challenges compared to the easily disposable mobs found around the map. ++ Good map. A good map is always essential in these types of games. Important to show what kind of obstacle blocks each path, secrets, markers, etc. ++ Story was ok. I know nothing of Metroid lore whatsoever so that probably didn't help. Otherwise its a pretty simple \"escape the planet\" scenario and figure out why the big bad wants with you. Serviceable. - Frustrating switch controls. This is more to do with the Switch, and its not the first time I have issues with the control scheme (hello DBZ). A game like Metroid requires a lot of jumping and using multiple abilities to get to secrets or beat a boss and I found myself messing up often cause my fingers couldnt do the jump and hold another button for an attack while also shooting stuff all on one hand. - Reliance on counters / parry. This is also a general gaming trend I'm not particularly fond of. I've never enjoyed parry mechanics. I hate that waiting for the enemy to make a move is the correct play instead of just proactively using my attacks and abilities. Dread has a few bosses you absolutely have to parry, it also insta kills any mob enemy. Theres also a frustrating one where they want to enemy to be scary to be chased by it cause they are invulnerable, but can be parried for a stun. Except the parry window is random every time with a particularly tiny window.

Travel all over ancient France to seek answers and a cure. ++++ Sound design was exquisite. Absolutely nailed the music and sounds. Distinct cues for exploration were nice and the rat music (high pitched eerie violin) never failed to raise the hair on my arms and keep me on edge. +++ Decent amount of gameplay mix-ups. One of the best upgrades from the first game is how it managed to branch out from mostly just stealthing. This time around you got companions for most levels with unique abilities, you had a deadly crossbow for a more lethal approach, limited command of rats at times, more assassination options. There were also several really fun escape sequences and a hide-and-seek moment as well. A lot of variation with rat-dodging puzzles and stealthing past soldiers (but that was the least interesting one in my opinion). ++++ Fun worldbuilding with the plague. You spend a lot of time in the game uncovering mysteries about the plague and encounter cults and orders that sprung up around it. One of the best aspects of the game. +++ Great well thought characters with depth. A story focused game like this lives and dies by how good the characters are written. Loved how much they talked to each other all the time and deepened their bonds, even if some motivations might have been iffy at times. +++ A lot of very nice set pieces. The story manages to make you travel quite a bit from bustling cities, isolated islands, abandoned forts, coastlines, deep underground secret cathedrals and more! +++ The story was interesting and well paced. With 17 unique chapters, there was a good mix of action moments followed by slower exploration and character building chapters. Culminating in some fast pace high tension ending with good story payoffs for every character. Was well done. +++ Good voice acting. Fully voice acted game with great range of emotions (in both English and French (it is a French game after all)) ++ The rat tech is impressive as always. Displaying easily 50 000 moving rats on screen at once without losing any frames is always wild to see. ++ Perfect game length at 15-20h.

I know stealthing is the main gameplay mechanic and I\u2019m happy they changed it up a lot but there were still 2-3 levels where I died a lot getting impatient waiting for guards to move back and forth.
