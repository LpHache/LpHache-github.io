You are an envoy from the Smoldering City, a town at the center of the map that is the only place that doesn't get destroyed by the Blightstorm. The Blightstorm is a terrible event that wipes out the entire map after a certain amount of time, including all settlements you made and the map layout (this is what defines an entire AtS run). In between storms you venture out to make settlements that will gather resources for the city (permanent upgrades to your runs) if they succeed, and bring you closer to fixing broken seals that are far away from the city(the objective of each run, fixing increasingly harder seals). A successful seal fixing will increase the time between storms, allowing you to venture further out to the harder seals. Now each settlement you make will be completely different, it's hard to explain every game mechanic here as there are so many, but you have to reach 14 victory points before you reach 14 impatience points and lose. You will have access to different buildings every run (can\u2019t rely on one in particular) and get access to new ones at set victory point levels. You get cornerstone choices to give bonuses as well that will be different each time. Your city will always have 3 of 5 possible races of villagers. Each one has different housing needs, complex food needs, and service needs to be happy. Very happy villagers will give you victory points so you want to fulfill as much as you can. However the forest isn\u2019t happy you are there, there are dangerous and forbidden glades all around you that have events in them. Solving them in time with the proper ressources will give you bonuses but if you can\u2019t finish it, you\u2019ll end up with huge negative modifiers. There\u2019s also a storm every 8 in-game minutes that will give huge debuffs to all your villagers and when they are too unhappy they will start leaving in droves, increasing the impatience and making it harder to run all the buildings in your settlement. It's all a very big balancing act to win your settlement and move on to the next to reach the seals. ++++ Extremely engaging and varied gameplay. This game is crazy fun, you take the frostpunk concept of keeping a city alive in adverse conditions and shove it into a repeatable roguelite shell and wow you get this game. Each settlement is so different with buildings, cornerstones, queen\u2019s orders, races, biomes, soil, traders, events encountered and more. Yes you build a city every run but they are never close to the same. ++++ Ton of strategy and planning involved. You need to deal with map modifiers. You need to keep track of fuel for your hearths by cutting wood or gathering coal. You need to pump out planks, bricks and fabrics as building materials to build homes and complex shelters. You need to set up farms and gathering camps to keep up with the food demand and start making complex foods using those basics like pies, porridge, skewers and more. You need to get service buildings like Taverns, temples, and bathhouses to please the different races of your city and supply those with ale, tea, incense, etc to satisfy everyone\u2019s needs. You need to pack provisions and goods in boxes to trade them with other cities and traders to make money to buy out stuff you can produce. You need to manage how angry the forest is at you and all the negative effects with cornerstones or upgrading your Hearths. You need to manage your collected rainwater to run your rainpunk engines that increase production. You need to manage the Blightrot spawning and corrupting your hearths. Every new villager means more mouths to feed, more housing required but also more hands to get to work. If you don't do even 1 of the things above, your town might fail and people will start leaving. It\u2019s extremely satisfying to get a good settlement rolling and producing everything. ++++ Meaningful upgrades and rewards. After almost every settlement you can go to the main city and upgrade something like better starting ressources, more trade routes, better prices and so much more. Always make you look forward to the next run with your upgrade. +++ Performs very well. This game opens and loads into your game in about 10 seconds flat. It's insane. Makes it so easy to just load in real quick for even just a few minutes anytime you want. Runs super well on x3 speed, never had any issues or bugs. +++ Good sound design. Important audio cues tell you when something needs your attention at all times. Nice little background music as well. +++ Super customizable difficulty. You have 4 basic difficulties that change a few major things. You can play with those as much as you want but each new seal demands a higher difficulty. The first three need to be beat at normal, hard and very hard respectively. Then there are 20 prestige levels and every single one makes one aspect significantly harder (costlier rerolls, longer storms, harder orders, more expensive buildings, etc) that need to be beaten in order to unlock the next. And the last 4 seals need to be beat at prestige 5, 10, 15 and 20 to beat the whole game. (I stopped at prestige 5) ++ Cool biomes. There are 6 different biomes each with their different modifiers and unique ways of playing on them. Really loved switching around which biome I'd build in. - The game can be long to finish (if you care about finishing things). At 120h, I still have about half the game left if I want to complete all upgrades and beat all the challenges, and that's with only 1 failed prestige 5 run. Each town at x3 speed can be up to 30-35mins long (without pausing, which you do A LOT of) and you\u2019ll have to make 5-7 towns before reaching a seal and restarting a new run. (But it's also really fun to do all of that so is it really that bad?) (and tbf, stopping after any seal you completed is also a super valid thing to do) - I want more biomes, and just more of everything. Visually it can be a bit samey at times with the forest and glades all looking alike, so I wish there was a bigger variety of in game areas to play around with.","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#against-the-storm","text":"","title":"Against The Storm"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#score-9510","text":"","title":"Score: 9.5/10"},{"location":"reviews/againstthestorm/#playtime-120-hours","text":"Against the Storm is a roguelite city builder game that is quite fantastic.

You are stuck on an island in an endless time loop except it seems you're able to remember things even if the day resets. You're one of the nine founding members (visionnaries) of this facility and you quickly realise you want to break this endless loop as there is no end in sight for it and that's no way to live. To do this you learn you need to kill all the founding members before the day resets to destabilize the loop. As such, you explore 4 distinct maps during 4 different time periods (morning, noon, afternoon, night) to uncover secrets and ways to kill each member in a single day. You can only explore one zone per time period, and time moves to the next period the moment you exit an area. So you have to plan out your day properly or risk having to redo it all. You get a nice variety of guns and powers stolen from other visionnaries. Throughout the game you have another visionnary, Julianna, who also keeps her memory and teases you and occasionaly also trying to kill you during your day. Game ends once you successfuly kill each member in a single day. The Good ++++ Main characters are well done. I really loved the MC and his voice actor. Lots of personality coming through with nice character growth as the game goes on. Julianna was done similarly well. ++++ Maps are rewarding to explore. Yes there are only 4 maps, but they have very different enemy layouts and opening depening on what time of day you come. A map in the morning won't play out the same way when you visit at night which makes revisits always fresh and interesting. They are also a good size to cross them pretty quickly when you know what you are doing while leaving room to explore a lot if that is you goal. Struck a nice balance there. There are also loads of hidden secrets if you have the patience and interest to uncover them. Some older version of me might have, but I held back the completionist this time around. +++ Time loops are neat. Like with Outer Wilds, I just think its a neat concept that your main weapon is your knowledge and you could have finished it at any time. +++ The weapons support many playstyles and are fun. Combat is important, and the weapons feel good to use. You can be nailing people in the head for steal or melting them with a laser beam. You could be going in guns blazing akimbo pistol with explosive headshots too. Fun for the whole family. ++ I liked the powers. Some were powers you commonly see in every game like stealth and teleport, but there were different cool ones like linking enemies and blinding them. Each also had two extra upgrades. Bit of a shame that most of the time the best course of action was just to nail headshot guys so I didn't end up using them much (except invisiblity). ++ Cool multiplayer idea. At any time you can decide to play as Julianna instead of Colt and go around invading other player's loops to ruin their day. Fun idea kind of like dark souls invading. I turned it off though cause once I \"paused\" to go pee and came back to all my lives lost cause I got invaded. I need my pauses. +/- The story is serviceable. For most of the game, it was pretty good. Loved discovering about the island's past and the characters on it, but I found the ending really unsatisfying. I'm someone who likes answers, and there sure as hell were none there. The Bad -- The load times can be pretty long. Even on my NVME SSD, it could take minutes to load a map. -- The AI is plain bad. This was a common complaint of the game and it is very true. The enemies just aren't very interesting to fight at all. They simply rush your position and shoot you at near point blank range if they heard you or stay where they are and shoot. They dont have powers, they don't use items except a couple of grenades (rarely), and all have the same weapons as you. There's no real cover system either. Fighting them alone is basically trivial but the moment a large amount have noticed you you simply die because you have no defensive tools (shields or heals) and no real area attacks either. It makes going for the action road a real bummer since it feels like it wasn't designed for that. -- No enemy variety. In conjunction with the previous point, it made combat fairly boring. The only difference were their weapons (and lets be honest difference betwen AR and shotgun was meaningless for enemies) and that the visionnaries had 1 power. But they died just as fast so its not like it made an interesting boss fight or anything. There was even a system where you can tag enemies and it displays their weapons, but also details like \"aggressive, has good aim, persistent, etc\" and it gets you thinking you can use this strategically but its just useless. Game could have used enemies with shields or with some armor and such. -- Lack of present day worldbuilding. Honestly we learn a lot about the past, quite a bit on the name characters, but next to nothing on the world.

The main systems of this game are exploration, choice, story, and turn-based tactical combat. The game is divided into four story acts all taking place in different locations with entirely new maps to chart out and explore. Now, there is a ton to go through with this game so I\u2019ll try to stick to the important stuff and keep it short. As always, let's talk about the great stuff first. The combat in this game is really excellent. The magical and physical armor system combat with all the buffs, debuffs, status elements and various environmental hazards created by spells made each encounter wildly different. The hundreds of abilities available for combat also made it so you can win encounters in a myriad of ways (or lose because of bad strategic calls). Second amazing thing about this game is the classes. Each class has a ton of skill options to choose from that provide unique effects on the battlefields, and the option to dip into any other class skills easily makes for truly interesting characters to pilot with a fun toolbox for each encounter. Not to mention some of those skills were insanely fun to use and were pretty epic. Third is quests and explorations. Exploring in this game is extremely rewarding as you often find high level gear and unique items in the most remote locations. It also allows you to find alternate routes for quests which I found really cool. There were also often 1-2 secret passageways leading to enemy bases that allowed you to sneak in the base, or sneak past guards. Really felt like the game was letting you approach each encounter the way you wanted to. This led to quests being a lot more interesting, each having different outcomes on the paths you took coming in, as well as your dialogue choices over the course of the quest. Additionally the companions were all pretty interesting, I liked their stories more than the main quest, I just wish they were a bit more fleshed out. Finally, I thought the first 2 acts were super enjoyable to explore and delve deeper into the story and all the characters. Final additional note: The last boss fight of the game was super awesome and very challenging Now for the less enjoyable parts. First and foremost in the whole inventory system. While the loot and equipment grind was fun, always finding and getting newer and better gear, the rest of the inventory was a pain. First, important story items and not always marked as such and are easily misplaced, sold, or otherwise lost. Second, crafting is completely wasted in this game. All the components are basically wasted and just hog up room and weight. This is because nothing you can craft ever comes close to being as good as anything you find by exploring or even simply buying. Crafting should reward players for investing into it and getting recipes but the game doesn't do that (and there are barely any recipes you can get). Lastly, I really wanted one of my characters to make good use of bombs, grenades, and traps, but those items scale so horribly they are basically useless in the second half of the game and it made me sad. I wish one of the classes supported it better. As for the story, I found it increasingly hard to keep track of once we reached acts 3 and 4. Gods are good, gods are bad, allies are now enemies, enemies are now allies, nothing matters except that one end scene of act 3 and the final few moments of act 4. I thought act 4 dragged on too much, I was ready for a good final streamlined act to lead in to the boss but it was just as open as previous acts. One last point is basic QOL features being locked behind mods, which in turn disable achievements. Simple things like running faster, everyone having the pet pal skill, and source regenerating during sleep made the game so much smoother, especially since source in general was constantly overcosted both in memory slots and how much was available in game. Overall , I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9 /10 score. I believe it's a game with incredible depth from the characters to the quests to the class system and skills available. It starts off strong with immense maps providing multiple approaches to the world and also rewarding adventurous players with treasure for their exploration. The fights are well built, and the combat is fun and strategic. However, the game struggles to close up its story beats in an adequate manner leading to an awkward ending where everyone is evil. It also made the last 2 acts feel longer than they should have been. The inventory is also a huge mess paired with a crafting system that feels incomplete and does not scale well at all. Finally, the source system felt imbalanced with default source being barely available in game in conjunction with source skills requiring 2 or even 3 memory points each felt very frustrating. Super happy I played it though I had a blast with the spells and classes and having 4 unique builds to pilot every fight. The Good ++++ Flexible class system, builds and skills ++++ Rewarding exploration +++ Strategic combat +++ Intriguing characters with fun quests +++ 4 interactive open world maps ++ Interesting main story The Bad - Rushed and confusing story ending -- Useless crafting system with poor scaling (like throwables) -- Near necessary QOL features locked behind mods (disabling achievements)","title":"Divinity Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#divinity-original-sin-2","text":"","title":"Divinity: Original Sin 2"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#score-910","text":"","title":"Score: 9/10"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#playtime-115-hours","text":"","title":"Playtime: 115 hours"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#platform-pc","text":"","title":"Platform: PC"},{"location":"reviews/divinityostwo/#storefront-steam","text":"Divinity Original Sin 2 is, as Simon put it, an epic high fantasy RPG played from a top-down, isometric perspective. The main systems of this game are exploration, choice, story, and turn-based tactical combat. The game is divided into four story acts all taking place in different locations with entirely new maps to chart out and explore. Now, there is a ton to go through with this game so I\u2019ll try to stick to the important stuff and keep it short. As always, let's talk about the great stuff first. The combat in this game is really excellent. The magical and physical armor system combat with all the buffs, debuffs, status elements and various environmental hazards created by spells made each encounter wildly different. The hundreds of abilities available for combat also made it so you can win encounters in a myriad of ways (or lose because of bad strategic calls). Second amazing thing about this game is the classes. Each class has a ton of skill options to choose from that provide unique effects on the battlefields, and the option to dip into any other class skills easily makes for truly interesting characters to pilot with a fun toolbox for each encounter. Not to mention some of those skills were insanely fun to use and were pretty epic. Third is quests and explorations. Exploring in this game is extremely rewarding as you often find high level gear and unique items in the most remote locations. It also allows you to find alternate routes for quests which I found really cool. There were also often 1-2 secret passageways leading to enemy bases that allowed you to sneak in the base, or sneak past guards. Really felt like the game was letting you approach each encounter the way you wanted to. This led to quests being a lot more interesting, each having different outcomes on the paths you took coming in, as well as your dialogue choices over the course of the quest. Additionally the companions were all pretty interesting, I liked their stories more than the main quest, I just wish they were a bit more fleshed out. Finally, I thought the first 2 acts were super enjoyable to explore and delve deeper into the story and all the characters. Final additional note: The last boss fight of the game was super awesome and very challenging Now for the less enjoyable parts. First and foremost in the whole inventory system. While the loot and equipment grind was fun, always finding and getting newer and better gear, the rest of the inventory was a pain. First, important story items and not always marked as such and are easily misplaced, sold, or otherwise lost. Second, crafting is completely wasted in this game. All the components are basically wasted and just hog up room and weight. This is because nothing you can craft ever comes close to being as good as anything you find by exploring or even simply buying. Crafting should reward players for investing into it and getting recipes but the game doesn't do that (and there are barely any recipes you can get). Lastly, I really wanted one of my characters to make good use of bombs, grenades, and traps, but those items scale so horribly they are basically useless in the second half of the game and it made me sad.

In this game you start off a few years after the end of the first story and with most of your crew having move on to other endeavours. Eventually you learn about a secret planet beyond an impassable abyss that could help the resistance grow, and be safe from the empire. An old jedi has once made a compass to reach that planet and you spend your time going around the galaxy to find a way to get a compass a reach the planet. In classic action adventure fashion, gameplay involes a lot of combat encounters, exploration puzzles and skill challenges, collectibles, and boss fights. The Good ++++ Animations feel great and look awesome. I'm mostly talking about the fighting here. You have a lot of possible combos with your lightsaber and it just looks buttery smooth. Even with the long dual blade you just spin and dash and attack in 3 different directions with style. No weird clipping or rough transitions between moves, just looking awesome. ++++ Combat is really fun, cool lightsaber stances . You start off with most of your abilities (force push, pull, double jump, throw) and stances (single handed, dual-bladed) from the last game. However you gain 3 new stances in this game (dual wield, two-handed crossguard, and blaster / saber) which all play super differently from each other with not a single move in common. They each have their own skill tree as well with 4 or 5 combos each which makes for a lot of variety in fighting. Theres a good amount of different enemies so its always fun trying out different stances for different foes. Couple that with new force powers like lift, crush and confusion, and every encounter stays fresh. This is als oone of the few games where I found parrying enjoyable. I attribute this to parrying providing tangible benefits in combat as well as enemies not have weird attack delays like enemies in souls type games often do. When you see an attack coming, it'll land when you expect it to. ++++ Exploration is rewarding. Almost every branching path you find end with a reward, be it a cosmetic or some currency for a shop back in the hubs. There are a lot of little secret areas too for those with a good eye and like some small skill challenges. Never felt like my time was wasted trying to explore the map. There are also some mounts now that help with traversal if you dont want to fast travel too much. It helped that the puzzles and challenges hit the right spot of \"not a breeze, but never frustrating either.\" ++++ The worlds are gorgeous. Easy to tell from the trailers, the world is very detailed and feels nicely lived in. Super gorgeous points of view as well. Just overall beautiful. +++ The story is meaningful and has lots of good character progression. Love me a good story where you can feel like the characters are actually going through some stuff and overcoming it. I like the overall arcs were fun and there were good set pieces throughout. There were a lot of fun side characters as well but I just wish they did more than stand around the saloon the whole time. The side quests also felt meaningful and not just useless fetch quests such as rescuing people, exploring old jedi temples, defeating mighty beasts or shrugging off bounty hunters. ++ Great character customization You can change your hair, your beard, your pants and shirt and coat, 8 different lightsaber parts + 4 color accents with over 10 color pallets, 5 BD-1 robot parts with colors as well, and 3 blaster parts. Tons to make to your liking! ++ Great customization in settings Shoutout to the settings. You can very finely adjust stuff like parry timings, damage taken / dealt, how many hints you want in game, if you want to be able to skip dialog, among others. ++ Well implemented New Game + mode. I have too many games to play to do new game + on most, but this would be a contender. They give you a few cool options like new lightsaber colors (red, rainbow), option for entirely new and harder combat encounters for most of the game, option for increased damage for friends and foes, and a perk that changes how you look every time you die. Soundss like a good time for a replay. ++ Tons of shortcuts for easy exploration. After every almost single jumping or climbing section, you unlock a shortcut to skip it the next time around. Its really appreciated and makes coming back to those areas much less frustrating. ++ Good dialogue. Game is fully voiced like the previous one and the actors really nail it. Theres also a lot of very fun banter with all the dumb droids and stormtroopers that I enjoyed. + No ability reset at game start. No being locked up and losing your saber, no weird memory loss. You're still the same strong fighter with all your powers and thats appreciated + You can pet the cute creatures. Nice. The Bad --- Optimization is rough, stuttering frames There aren't many loading screens in the game but theres often a lot going on on-screen at once which cause frame loss pretty often. I had to reduce to medium settings to make it bearable but it was quite unfortunate how bad it was. It really permeatted the whole experience. -- No fast travel between planets To go along with the first point, you often have to go through long animations with poor loading to change planets instead of simply fast traveling to a known point.

An old jedi has once made a compass to reach that planet and you spend your time going around the galaxy to find a way to get a compass a reach the planet. In classic action adventure fashion, gameplay involes a lot of combat encounters, exploration puzzles and skill challenges, collectibles, and boss fights.","title":"Storefront: Xbox Game Pass"},{"location":"reviews/jedisurvivor/#the-good","text":"++++ Animations feel great and look awesome. I'm mostly talking about the fighting here. You have a lot of possible combos with your lightsaber and it just looks buttery smooth. Even with the long dual blade you just spin and dash and attack in 3 different directions with style. No weird clipping or rough transitions between moves, just looking awesome. ++++ Combat is really fun, cool lightsaber stances . You start off with most of your abilities (force push, pull, double jump, throw) and stances (single handed, dual-bladed) from the last game. However you gain 3 new stances in this game (dual wield, two-handed crossguard, and blaster / saber) which all play super differently from each other with not a single move in common. They each have their own skill tree as well with 4 or 5 combos each which makes for a lot of variety in fighting. Theres a good amount of different enemies so its always fun trying out different stances for different foes. Couple that with new force powers like lift, crush and confusion, and every encounter stays fresh. This is als oone of the few games where I found parrying enjoyable. I attribute this to parrying providing tangible benefits in combat as well as enemies not have weird attack delays like enemies in souls type games often do. When you see an attack coming, it'll land when you expect it to. ++++ Exploration is rewarding. Almost every branching path you find end with a reward, be it a cosmetic or some currency for a shop back in the hubs. There are a lot of little secret areas too for those with a good eye and like some small skill challenges. Never felt like my time was wasted trying to explore the map. There are also some mounts now that help with traversal if you dont want to fast travel too much. It helped that the puzzles and challenges hit the right spot of \"not a breeze, but never frustrating either.\" ++++ The worlds are gorgeous. Easy to tell from the trailers, the world is very detailed and feels nicely lived in. Super gorgeous points of view as well. Just overall beautiful. +++ The story is meaningful and has lots of good character progression.

There isn't much platforming (such as spike pits, spike wall, flying through tight spaces, etC) and focuses much more on combat and abilities to discover hidden areas. ++++ Looks fantastic. The game is gorgeous, easily its strongest point to me. The envrionments look very good and so do the enemies. Cutscenes are give or take but considering it's a Switch game theres only so much to do there. ++++ Map design is so good. Despite having 6 very large maps with hundreds of path, the game made sure the envrionments and configurations changed at every major point tonicely lead the player in the right direction. While some people enjoy the puzzle aspects of these types of games, where you have to search or remember which area was blocked that can now be opened, Dread is surprisingly linear. I appreciated that as getting lost and not knowing where to go is usually a big turn off for me. +++ Great progression with cool abilities. Every time I picked up the game, I managed to find at least an upgrade for my suit within a session. Getting new rockets, new suit resists, new bombs, etc. These help change up the gameplay and always open up new paths to keep you going. ++ Interesting boss battles.

A game like Metroid requires a lot of jumping and using multiple abilities to get to secrets or beat a boss and I found myself messing up often cause my fingers couldnt do the jump and hold another button for an attack while also shooting stuff all on one hand. - Reliance on counters / parry. This is also a general gaming trend I'm not particularly fond of. I've never enjoyed parry mechanics. I hate that waiting for the enemy to make a move is the correct play instead of just proactively using my attacks and abilities. Dread has a few bosses you absolutely have to parry, it also insta kills any mob enemy.

It is a first person action survival horror game where you play as Ethan Winters, lost in a remote and ancient village somewhere in the Romanian countryside, trying to get back his daughter, Rose. The game starts with her and you being kidnapped and you waking up in the woods after the car of the kidnappers crashes. You then find yourself in a village watched over by strange beings, trying to find the answer to where Rose is. I will preface the good parts with the fact that I am usually not a fan of horror especially by myself, Dead Space being kind of the limit of spooky that I\u2019m willing to go to. That being said, this game blew me out of the water. This game toed the line between action and horror perfectly. I always felt like I was in control (except that 1 time in the dollhouse), that I could defend myself, and that if I died it was because I missed crucial shots and not because of a weird gimmick or something unexpected. Enemies are properly introduced and you get a good feel for the limits of your weapons and how to approach each situation. Secondly , they absolutely nailed the spooky atmosphere of an abandoned village in the middle of nowhere. Even in broad daylight I was on my toes thanks to the music, the world design, the sound effects and the constant ominous feeling looming over you that something awful was going to happen. This meant the game didn't really have to resort to cheap jump scares to keep you frightened. It helped that the game is super detailed and the textures are fantastic leading to a very realistic setting and believable world. Thirdly , the combat had weight. Every bullet mattered, no matter from which gun it was shot. They had appropriate impact, they felt good to use, and I was surprised at the amount of guns we got to use (around 8 I believe). On the flipside the enemies were all very cool and scary in their own right. There was a good balance of ammos / tools to enemies as well, meaning I wasn't afraid to use all my tools but also making sure none were wasted. The fourth great thing about this game was the exploration and map. I love a good map that tells me when I found everything that could be found in every room I explored. It made said exploration rewarding without dragging on cause I knew there was nothing left to find. The fifth great thing was the bosses. The game is quite distinctly separated in 5 zones each with their own atmosphere and boss that is super unique. Each one has an awesome fight that represented them well and an area that represented totally different types of horror. The last great thing about this game are the characters. They might not get much dialogue but most were really fleshed out and had a great personality (like Lady D.). I loved the Duke (the merchant) a lot and Heisenberg too. Honestly I couldn't find much I didn\u2019t enjoy about this game except the fact our protagonist Ethan is so dumb and has the worst one-liners evers, but it's also kind of funny at the same time. Overall , I give RE: Village my first 10 /10 of the year. I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed this game. I was looking forward to playing it every day. It was super engaging and there were always new elements being introduced to shake things up. The fighting was awesome. The atmosphere was superb. The setting and world were gorgeous. The sound design was just perfect (ok maybe picking items was a little too dramatic but otherwise it was good). The boss fights were fantastic and fun. The story was simple and straightforward. The characters were well thought out. Exploring was great. The horror was well built in. Just an overall amazing experience that was well paced and just the right length. Would recommend.

This game was released in 2010 for PS3 originally and you can easily tell it has that classic old action style to it. Each mission has a time tracker at the end with bonus points for a fast clear, among other stats it uses. It also has no store, no skins, no items, no inventory or any other complimentary system. You get 3 guns and 2 grenades at all times, at a \u201cheat\u201d meter that limits your dashing speed boost, slo-mo near death time, and the laser gun weapon. You also have a really bad melee attack that instantly overheats you. That's the extent of the mechanics. There are 13 guns in total, all of which are actually pretty fun to use and different. When you pick up a weapon while you have max ammo with it already it upgrades to a slightly better version up to a maximum. There is basically no downtime in this game. You are always in some sort of action packed firefight zooming across with your boosts and trying to not die and that aspect is really fun. The enemies in the game are actually pretty varied. Beyond the small mob robots you have various deadlier super bots, enemy super suits, weird experiments, tanks, and giant death robots. The level design is surprisingly good for a game of this era. Lots of verticality and not too many reused areas despite being fairly linear and in an orbital colony that from above all looks the same. The story however is pretty lackluster and falls apart pretty quickly if you look at it too closely (like spending an entire arc saving some colonists because they could have intel on enemy positions but that info never comes up again and even if it did it makes no sense that hiding refugees would have anything useful). It definitely feels like Michael Bay could have come up with it. I will say the ending isn\u2019t awful though. There are plenty of neat cutscenes throughout though and those are alright. Overall, I rate Vanquish 8.5 /10. It's a fun action packed high octane shooter that never lets go of the pedal and lets you use a variety of cool weapons to lay waste to a horde of robots and giant mechs. The design is pretty good and the mechanics are simple and straightforward. However the story is forgettable and the game doesn't give you any new tools beyond the first hour to change things up but that's forgivable with its short playtime.

This game was released in 2010 for PS3 originally and you can easily tell it has that classic old action style to it. Each mission has a time tracker at the end with bonus points for a fast clear, among other stats it uses. It also has no store, no skins, no items, no inventory or any other complimentary system. You get 3 guns and 2 grenades at all times, at a \u201cheat\u201d meter that limits your dashing speed boost, slo-mo near death time, and the laser gun weapon. You also have a really bad melee attack that instantly overheats you. That's the extent of the mechanics. There are 13 guns in total, all of which are actually pretty fun to use and different.
