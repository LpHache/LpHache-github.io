**Star Wars: Jedi Survivor** is the 2nd action adventure Star Wars game where you play as Cal Kestis. In this game you start off a few years after the end of the first story and with most of your crew having move on to other endeavours. Eventually you learn about a secret planet beyond an impassable abyss that could help the resistance grow, and be safe from the empire. An old jedi has once made a compass to reach that planet and you spend your time going around the galaxy to find a way to get a compass a reach the planet. In classic action adventure fashion, gameplay involes a lot of combat encounters, exploration puzzles and skill challenges, collectibles, and boss fights. <br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Animations feel great and look awesome.** I'm mostly talking about the fighting here. You have a lot of possible combos with your lightsaber and it just looks buttery smooth. Even with the long dual blade you just spin and dash and attack in 3 different directions with style. No weird clipping or rough transitions between moves, just looking awesome.<br/>
**++++ Combat is really fun, cool lightsaber stances .** You start off with most of your abilities (force push, pull, double jump, throw) and stances (single handed, dual-bladed) from the last game. However you gain 3 new stances in this game (dual wield, two-handed crossguard, and blaster / saber) which all play super differently from each other with not a single move in common. They each have their own skill tree as well with 4 or 5 combos each which makes for a lot of variety in fighting. Theres a good amount of different enemies so its always fun trying out different stances for different foes. Couple that with new force powers like lift, crush and confusion, and every encounter stays fresh. This is als oone of the few games where I found parrying enjoyable. I attribute this to parrying providing tangible benefits in combat as well as enemies not have weird attack delays like enemies in souls type games often do. When you see an attack coming, it'll land when you expect it to.<br/>
**++++ Exploration is rewarding.** Almost every branching path you find end with a reward, be it a cosmetic or some currency for a shop back in the hubs. There are a lot of little secret areas too for those with a good eye and like some small skill challenges. Never felt like my time was wasted trying to explore the map. There are also some mounts now that help with traversal if you dont want to fast travel too much. It helped that the puzzles and challenges hit the right spot of "not a breeze, but never frustrating either."<br/>
**++++ The worlds are gorgeous.** Easy to tell from the trailers, the world is very detailed and feels nicely lived in. Super gorgeous points of view as well. Just overall beautiful.<br/>
**+++ The story is meaningful and has lots of good character progression.** Love me a good story where you can feel like the characters are actually going through some stuff and overcoming it. I like the overall arcs were fun and there were good set pieces throughout. There were a lot of fun side characters as well but I just wish they did more than stand around the saloon the whole time. The side quests also felt meaningful and not just useless fetch quests such as rescuing people, exploring old jedi temples, defeating mighty beasts or shrugging off bounty hunters.<br/>
**++ Great character customization** You can change your hair, your beard, your pants and shirt and coat, 8 different lightsaber parts + 4 color accents with over 10 color pallets, 5 BD-1 robot parts with colors as well, and 3 blaster parts. Tons to make to your liking!<br/>
**++ Great customization in settings** Shoutout to the settings. You can very finely adjust stuff like parry timings, damage taken / dealt, how many hints you want in game, if you want to be able to skip dialog, among others. <br/>
**++ Well implemented New Game + mode.** I have too many games to play to do new game + on most, but this would be a contender. They give you a few cool options like new lightsaber colors (red, rainbow), option for entirely new and harder combat encounters for most of the game, option for increased damage for friends and foes, and a perk that changes how you look every time you die. Soundss like a good time for a replay.<br/>
**++ Tons of shortcuts for easy exploration.** After every almost single jumping or climbing section, you unlock a shortcut to skip it the next time around. Its really appreciated and makes coming back to those areas much less frustrating.<br/>
**++ Good dialogue.** Game is fully voiced like the previous one and the actors really nail it. Theres also a lot of very fun banter with all the dumb droids and stormtroopers that I enjoyed.<br/>
**+ No ability reset at game start.** No being locked up and losing your saber, no weird memory loss. You're still the same strong fighter with all your powers and thats appreciated<br/>
**+ You can pet the cute creatures.** Nice.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**--- Optimization is rough, stuttering frames**  There aren't many loading screens in the game but theres often a lot going on on-screen at once which cause frame loss pretty often. I had to reduce to medium settings to make it bearable but it was quite unfortunate how bad it was. It really permeatted the whole experience.<br/>
**-- No fast travel between planets** To go along with the first point, you often have to go through long animations with poor loading to change planets instead of simply fast traveling to a known point. Seemed like it could have been better.<br/>
