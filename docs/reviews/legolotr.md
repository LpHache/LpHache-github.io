Notes

- copy pasted dialogue from the movie thats away of lot from the game. Everything is 100% predictable
- Can see coop UI even when not coop
- switching characters all the time for their unique thing is tedious
- Game at its best when its beeing silly with lego things
- The traversal and puzzles are alright, simple things
- Combat is boring, no nuance at all
- bosses are too much "wait around for the vulnerability window, hit once, wait again."
- Game is mostly made to backtrack with other characters and hunt for all the secrets. Main story doesnt have much going for it.
