**Lego Lord of the Rings** is, as the name implies, the Lego version of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in game form. You switch between all the fellowship characters as you go throw all the main action story beats that are in the movies. In between missions there is an open world where you can solve a bunch of puzzles using all the characters, do simple quests, and hunt for all the collectibles / achievments.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
As my first Lego game, I sort of expected going into it that it would be a more silly interpretation of the movies with loads of visual gags. I was so wrong. It's mostly a 11 to 1 recreation of the movies including copied voice lines. I was so disappointed there was no innovation at all of anything to look forward to story wise once I caught on. The missions were decent enough though with good simple puzzles and stuff so I still enjoyed my time doing those at least. I was annoyed that I couldn't even explore the map properly because you could only solve a bunch of challenges on a second playthrough. I'd only recommend if you want to play a LOTR themed collect-a-thon and want to focus on anything except the main story of the game.


#### **The Good**
**+++ The exploration and puzzles are nice.** Pretty much everywhere you look there's a little puzzle to solve or something to do, especially when not in a mission. Nice if you're into that.<br/>
**+++ Great when it leans into silly Lego stuff.** My favorite parts are when the game leans into visual comedy with silly Lego jokes. Wish they did it more often.<br/>
**+++ A lot of side activities to do.** If you like collecitng things and exploring an entire world for all its secrets, this game has you covered.<br/>
**++ The missions were good enough.** They did a good job keeping things varied with the puzzles and characters and how the missions played out.<br/>
**++ It's still LOTR.** The setting and characters are cool, because it's LOTR.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- Combat is only 1 button press.** It's quite boring, you press X and any enemy dies except bosses. Nothing interesting at play here for how often there is combat.<br/>
**- Managing all the characters is tedious.** Especially in the first movie you control 9 people. They all have a unique skill that others can't do. Lot's of switching involved.<br/>
**- Time gated bosses were lame.** As in, hit once, turn in circles for 2 minutes for the next "hit window", then hit again. Rince and repeat.<br/>
**-- Heavy Coop design.** The game was clearly designed for co-op in mind and it was a bit annoying playing single player and seeing the co-op UI at all times or having a second character shoved in for co-op even when alone. If I plugged in my controller after launching the game I'd have to restart it cause it would only consider the controller a second player.<br/>
**-- All the fun of exploring is killed off.** I stopped bothering to explore when I realise that in every mission and every area, all the fun puzzles to get collectibles are locked behind puzzles you can't solve with the main cast. You have to replay the whole game in free play once you're done to actually enjoy any of it, which I did not want to do.<br/>
**--- Copied the movie WAY too much.** I'm new to Lego games, so I'm not sure what I was expecting. However, I wasn't expecting them to re-use dialogue pulled straight from the movies, in identical scenes, with identical camera work of all things. There was no surprise. It all played out exactly as in the movie, which was very disappointing to me. I feel like there was so much room to add a lot of Lego comedy and to re-interpret things while still following the same story.<br/>
