Another amazing entry in the Total War: Warhammer that brings half a dozen new factions, a bigger Immortal Empire map, and a new Chaos Campaign.

**++++ Don’t need to install both previous games to enjoy all the content.** You had to do that with TWWII.<br/>
**++++ Battles are just as epic as ever.** New factions, units and siege battles always make for great fights.<br/>
**++++ Revamped diplomacy with outposts is pretty nice.** Easier to recruit units from allies and spend alliance points of war coordination.<br/>
**+++ Ton of strategic depth.** There are thousands of ways to approach every campaign.<br/>
**+++ Factions are impressively distinct from each other.** They all have various tools and goals that differentiate them despite using the same overworld mechanics.<br/>
**+++ Water teleporters.** Finally, we can fast travel by boat with some teleporters.<br/>
**+++ Way easier trade.** No longer limited to direct capital - capital line.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**--- Turns can get very long.** Especially in Immortal Empires.<br/>
**-- Campaign victories can take too long to reach.** Short victory is not interesting, and long can be over 100 turns easily, if not 150 (even in Realm of Chaos)<br/>
**- Can’t help but feel that despite all their differences there's too much that's the same between all factions** (Getting settlements, building infrastructure, Lord levels, movement, etc) Not much to do about it though.
