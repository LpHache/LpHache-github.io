**Vampire Survivors** is a very simple game that basically spawned a new genre of games called "Bullet Heaven". Simply put, you choose a character, choose a map, then slay hoardes of enemies coming at you indefinitely with weapons that automatically fire at set intervals. Your only input is moving around to pick up items and experience that make you level up and choose new weapons and upgrades.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ The gameplay is so simple yet so compelling.** Who would have though simply moving in 2D space would be so fun. The steady pogression from 1 weapon shooting once per second to 6 weapons obliterating everything on screen every microsecond is just pure dopamine. Survival in the early game is key and keeps it engaging until you reach your builds. Having to make choices often for each level that influence your build kept it interactive as well.<br/>
**++++ The progression systems are perfect.** I loved the easy list of achievements. It gave a clear goal for every run and showed mostly what would be unlocked every time. So even when youre easily blasting everything you have a goal to go for or a unique build to try. It also meant that after every run you usually had something new to try out to keep things fresh. Seeing the achievement list getting smaller and smaller as you go for 100% tingled my brain.<br/>
**++++ Great selection of weapons.** All the weapons in the game feel like they are viable. I think each are fun in their own way and have their place in one build or another. When boosted and upgraded they all look destructive and cool too. There are so many cool combos with Arcanas too. No two runs are alike.<br/>
**+++ The meta story progression was fun.** There isn't REALLY a story in this game, but going through the main maps and then special maps searching for the next item that would allow you to unlock the next part was fun. Plus eventually defeating death and the final boss was very satisfying.<br/>
**++ Good challenges and secrets.** There are 14 secret characters to unlock at the end which I thought were fun challenges to do for powerful characters.
**++ DLC maps are pretty cool.** I really enjoyed the detailed map of Mt. Moonspell. Gave each run interesting places to go on the map.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- I think the UI could have been improved.** Wish there was a way to access achievements from in-game, or even from the map screen since those are the main objectives.<br/>
**-- The game becomes too trivial near the end.** Near the last 3rd of the game, every run becomes very straightforward once your understand all the best characters and combos. Plus some characters are legitimately invincible. Takes away from the gameplay in my opinion.<br/>
