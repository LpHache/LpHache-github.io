Plague tale is a narrative driven stealth game played in 3rd person (Similar to The Last of Us), where you play as Amicia trying to save her brother from a deadly rat-controlling plague. Travel all over ancient France to seek answers and a cure.

**++++ Sound design was exquisite.** Absolutely nailed the music and sounds. Distinct cues for exploration were nice and the rat music (high pitched eerie violin) never failed to raise the hair on my arms and keep me on edge.<br/>
**+++ Decent amount of gameplay mix-ups.** One of the best upgrades from the first game is how it managed to branch out from mostly just stealthing. This time around you got companions for most levels with unique abilities, you had a deadly crossbow for a more lethal approach, limited command of rats at times, more assassination options. There were also several really fun escape sequences and a hide-and-seek moment as well. A lot of variation with rat-dodging puzzles and stealthing past soldiers (but that was the least interesting one in my opinion).<br/>
**++++ Fun worldbuilding with the plague.** You spend a lot of time in the game uncovering mysteries about the plague and encounter cults and orders that sprung up around it. One of the best aspects of the game.<br/>
**+++ Great well thought characters with depth.** A story focused game like this lives and dies by how good the characters are written. Loved how much they talked to each other all the time and deepened their bonds, even if some motivations might have been iffy at times.<br/>
**+++ A lot of very nice set pieces.**  The story manages to make you travel quite a bit from bustling cities, isolated islands, abandoned forts, coastlines, deep underground secret cathedrals and more! <br/>
**+++ The story was interesting and well paced.** With 17 unique chapters, there was a good mix of action moments followed by slower exploration and character building chapters. Culminating in some fast pace high tension ending with good story payoffs for every character. Was well done.<br/>
**+++ Good voice acting.** Fully voice acted game with great range of emotions (in both English and French (it is a French game after all))<br/>
**++ The rat tech is impressive as always.** Displaying easily 50 000 moving  rats on screen at once without losing any frames is always wild to see.<br/>
**++ Perfect game length at 15-20h.** Doesn’t overstay its welcome, no filler levels.<br/>
**-- No real final boss.** The first game had a really epic rat-filled boss showdown that was great and I was hoping for something similar here. There was a fun sequence leading up to the end but it didn’t end with any fight or challenge.<br/>
**- Stealthing past guards did get tedious.** I know stealthing is the main gameplay mechanic and I’m happy they changed it up a lot but there were still 2-3 levels where I died a lot getting impatient waiting for guards to move back and forth. Too many games do this<br/>
**- Can’t 100% in one run (if you care about such things).** There aren’t enough materials or action sequences to level everything to the max for achievements. It required an NG+ run.
