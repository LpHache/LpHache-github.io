**Vanquish** is a 3rd person action shooter where you play as Sam, a special forces soldier in a super suit trying to stop the Russians from using an orbital microwave laser from wiping out another American city. This game was released in 2010 for PS3 originally and you can easily tell it has that classic old action style to it. Each mission has a time tracker at the end with bonus points for a fast clear, among other stats it uses. It also has no store, no skins, no items, no inventory or any other complimentary system. You get 3 guns and 2 grenades at all times, at a “heat” meter that limits your dashing speed boost, slo-mo near death time, and the laser gun weapon. You also have a really bad melee attack that instantly overheats you. That's the extent of the mechanics. There are 13 guns in total, all of which are actually pretty fun to use and different. When you pick up a weapon while you have max ammo with it already it upgrades to a slightly better version up to a maximum. There is basically no downtime in this game. You are always in some sort of action packed firefight zooming across with your boosts and trying to not die and that aspect is really fun.<br/>

The enemies in the game are actually pretty varied. Beyond the small mob robots you have various deadlier super bots, enemy super suits, weird experiments, tanks, and giant death robots. The level design is surprisingly good for a game of this era. Lots of verticality and not too many reused areas despite being fairly linear and in an orbital colony that from above all looks the same. The story however is pretty lackluster and falls apart pretty quickly if you look at it too closely (like spending an entire arc saving some colonists because they could have intel on enemy positions but that info never comes up again and even if it did it makes no sense that hiding refugees would have anything useful). It definitely feels like Michael Bay could have come up with it. I will say the ending isn’t awful though. There are plenty of neat cutscenes throughout though and those are alright. <br/>

Overall, I rate Vanquish 8.5 /10. It's a fun action packed high octane shooter that never lets go of the pedal and lets you use a variety of cool weapons to lay waste to a horde of robots and giant mechs. The design is pretty good and the mechanics are simple and straightforward. However the story is forgettable and the game doesn't give you any new tools beyond the first hour to change things up but that's forgivable with its short playtime. <br/>
