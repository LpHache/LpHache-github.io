**Creatures of Ava** is an exploration creature collector game where you play as Vic, who was sent to the planet Ava to rescue its creatures from a world-consuming rot. You rescue creatures by playing songs to them and bringing them to bots, and it also allows you to control them to solve exploration puzzles. Sometimes the creatures are infected and you have to cleanse them with a relic you find which will be imbued with a few abilities. Ava also hosts an intelligent species of bird-like folk that guide you to the different areas of the map, send you on quests, and play a bit part in the central story of rescuing everyone (including them).<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
In the end, I think the game was just "okay". It never really had any highs or big moments. Once you rescued your first creature, nothing new is every really introduced for the rest of the game and it all becomes the same. Story was decent and well told with some nice characters, but it was a bit of a chore to reach the end. I guess it also wasn't exactly the type of game I expected since you don't really collect creatures like pokemon. Once they are rescued, they disappear. You don't get to be attached to any of them, they are just a number. Can't say I would recommend much unless you're looking for something extra simple and cozy.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**+++ The world of Ava is very beautiful.** Exploration is nice with the 4 different biomes and the vibrant color palette of the game. Lots of high areas with good vistas.<br/>
**+++ Story is well told.** You can see how it will end fairly early on, but it was still told in a good way.<br/>
**+++ Characters are interesting.** There are a few npc's that had fun dialogue and good personal stories as well.<br/>
**++ Exploration was alright.** Fairly simple puzzle stuff with rescued creatures, otherwise lots of walking to places.<br/>
**++ Interesting creature design.** The creatures were fun to discover, not just recycled designs from other games.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- Sometimes, the writing was awful.** A few times the writing just really took me out of it. It fell very flat.<br/>
**- Combat was TOO simple.** Cleansing creatures involved holding LMB for a set amount of time. You coud dodge and jump to avoid hits, and use the few staff abilities. But the abilities were all just there to make the drain faster and safer.<br/>v
**-- No home base of creature collection area.** My biggest disappointement. It isn't actually a collecting game sincce theres no home area with your creatures, you can't name them, or raise them, or summon them at will. Once they are rescued they are just gone.<br/>
**-- Gameplay loop got stale.** Explore -> rescue creature -> use creature ability on environment to open new area -> repeat for all areas in all biomes ntil the quotas are met.<br/>
