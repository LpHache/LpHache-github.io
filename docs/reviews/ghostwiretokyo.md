Ghostwire Tokyo is a first person action RPG set in the bustling Shibuya district in Japan. A mysterious figure captures your sick sister and uses her as a vessel to fuse the underworld with the present and free everyone’s soul from their mortal flesh.<br/>

**++++ Beautiful Setting.** They really did a great job recreating a Japanese city. The areas are well crafted and fun to explore. Super detailed city. You’re often sent to shadow realms as well that are cool to see.<br/>

**++++ Fun theme.** Haven’t really played many RPGs that delve into Japanese urban legends, tropes,  and horror themes and they were really well done in this game. You have talking cat shopkeepers, friendly spirits (Yokai), haunted schools, cleansing Torii gates and shrines, etc.<br/>

**+++ Pretty unique combat skills.** Haven't really played with a similar system before. You basically control 3 elements (wind, water and fire) and can use that in a few different ways to blow up enemies and expose their cores, which you can then rip out for a nice execution.<br/>

**+++ A roguelite bonus mode that was well thought out.** Last year they released a full rogue-lite mode with a whole different skill tree, hand crafted levels, extra skills, and more. Really cool for those who love combat and want more from this game. I played a few levels and it was neat.<br/>

**+++ Really good enemy variety.** The “visitors” were all appropriately creepy and well designed. They were all manifestations of a particular negative emotion and played into that trope. Headless schoolchildren, faceless men in suits, flying hanged spirits, tall goth lady spirits with giant scissors. you get the idea.<br/>

**++ Decent open world.** The playable area was a good size, and filled with a bunch of classic open world stuff. Nothing super innovative in this area but I still enjoyed it. Cleansing gates to reveal map areas, shopkeeps, collectibles, small side quests, spirits to capture, etc. <br/>

**++ Some cool side quests.** Not all of them were great, but a few were really well done (haunted school, void subway station) and wish they had done more in that genre. Most involved releasing a spirit from something that kept them binded here (regrets, anger, and other emotions).<br/>

**--  The gameplay loop was lacking.** As much fun as the new skills and weapons and enemies were, the actual combat didn't feel as good as I wished. You are only equipped with ranged attacks (and most require a bit of charging) and a block, while enemies are mostly melee with a few exceptions. Combat then devolved into running backwards in circles shooting your pew pews at them and staying out of reach cause if they close the gap youre pretty defenseless. There's no cover or any particular strategies besides some stealthing so all encounters end up feeling sameish once you’ve seen the enemy before. It was missing a little oomph.<br/>

**-- The story was forgettable.** Sadly, the main story was pretty bland. MC is inhabited by a friendly ghost hunter and given powers. Chases the main bad guy around because he took his sister. Most quests involve fetching Macguffins that will allow us to reach him, or looking for old partners / clues of your spirit friend. No super well crafted main missions unfortunately.<br/>

**- Too much rain.** Really held the graphics back when trying to render heavy rain during half the game. woulda been nicer without it (even if the atmosphere would take a small hit).
