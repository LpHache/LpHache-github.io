Absolutely fantastic open world souls game. Everything I love about the series is present and amplified ten times. Gorgeous game and have barrels of fun playing it.

**++++ The world and level design is unparalleled.** Full of stunning vistas, catacombs, castles and secret areas. A joy to explore and downright massive in size.<br/>
**++++ Rewarding as hell.** Everything you do in this game is appropriately rewarded. Exploring every dark corner gives you items, every optional boss gives grand rewards. It makes everything you want to do worth it.<br/>
**++++ Customization is through the roof.** The amount of cool builds you can do in this game is crazy  and all of them seem very fun. The amount of cool armor, weapons, spirits, ashes, spells in this game is fantastic. Long live colossal weapons and heavy armor.<br/>
**++++ The sound effects go hard and reuse previous Soul’s sounds.** Classic death, bonfire, and weapon sounds are all super satisfying and well done.<br/>
**+++ Bosses are plentiful and fun to fight.** Sure a few of them repeat themselves, but I’m always happy to see a boss health bar appear. They are exciting to fight.<br/>
**+++ Dragon church, bosses, and spells.** Enough said.<br/>
**+++ As hard as you want it to be.** You can easily make the difficulty easier or harder through farming, summons, and spirit ashes (or not using those things).<br/>
**+++ Interesting NPCs with good stories.** Not all of them are long to do but most are all interesting for different reasons. I enjoyed fulfilling them.<br/>
**++ Good choice of endings.** Five different ones is not bad at all.<br/>


**- No mimic chests?** What's up with that FromSoftware.<br/>
**- Liurnia was a bit too big.**<br/>
**- Easy to miss like 90% of night time bosses.** Had to google them at the end to go fight all of them.
