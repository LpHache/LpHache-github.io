**Age of Mythology: Retold** is a remaster of the classic RTS of the same name. I only played through all campaigns and did not interact with mutliplayer or custom matches. The main story takes you through all the factions as you try to stop Gargarensis from releasing the Titans from the underwold. It throws you in a bunch of scenarios with various objectives that mostly all revolve around building a base, an army, and crushing your opponents.<br/>

#### The Good
**++++ Everything you loved from the original.** This remaster stays very true to the original game and changed very little beyond graphial and ai improvements, bug fixes, and a few quality of life fixes. Everything you loved from classic AoM, you will love it here too.<br/>
**++++ The campaign is actually really well done.** With 32 missions in the main campaign and an extra 14 for the DLC campaign, it actually has a good chunk of content. Its not Starcraft 2 with impressive cutscenes but the story makes sense, the characters are nice and they found a good way to make you play all factions evenly throughout. Was a really comoplete way to experience the game. I also really enjoyed how different they made each scenario. A lot of care went into making sure each missions had something to make it unique and not just another 1v1 base rush.<br/>
**+++ RTS are fun, and this is no exception.** Game is well balanced, interesting units and ages and building. Just fun to play really.<br/>
**+++ The units and god powers are just cool.** Just in general, I really enjoyed the army compositions, especially myth units. They also didnt have very complicated abilities that required intense micro which isn't my thing. God powers well, those are just a fun addition (like meteors and lightning).<br/>
**++ Banger soundtrack.** Thats it, the classic soundtrack is still great.<br/>

#### The Bad
**- Maybe a tad long.** While I still think it was fine as a whole, i think a couple of missions could have been left out that weren't super interesting. 50 total missions is quite a lot.<br/>
**-- Too many scenarios starting in Age 3.** The charm of most of the Age Of XYZ games are that you have to progress through ages to unlock new stuff, and in AoM you have to decide between 2 gods each with their own units and tech. Thats a really fun and interesting part of the game depending on what you focus is. However, in the campaign the game starts you in age 3 in like over half the missions and i thought that was really unfortunate. Age 4 is a luxury that isn't really necessary to win in most cases either, and sometimes even that was blocked. I think I got to choose my 2nd age only once. I guess its to shorten mission times and control the balance more but I wish it had been different.<br/>
**-- Wish we got to play with Titans more.** Even in the DLC campaign, you only ever get to control a Titan in the very last mission and not for very long. Titans were the whole gimmick of the DLC so I wish we got the mmore.<br/>
