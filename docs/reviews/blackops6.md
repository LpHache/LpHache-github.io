**Black Ops 6** is the latest installment of the classic FPS game. Set in the early 90's, you play as Rook, a member of the CIA's black ops squad. You spend the campaign chasing down and ever blacker secret ops team members gone rogue, named Pantheon. This paramilitary group has lots of funds and soldiers and have infiltrated high level US government. You must defeat Patheon and thwart the biological attack they are planning. The game also has a multitude of multiplayer modes and the amazing round based zombie mode is back with 3 new maps.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
I had a great time with this game overall. The campaign was a lot of fun with all the missions types and going back to a home base in between. You get lots of time to talk to characters too. The story didn't hit as hard as Modern Warfare 2 but it was pretty well done. Had a ton of fun in the zombies mode as well, the eldritch horror map is really hard and took me a few tries to reach the end (hard to do solo and takes 1h30 to reach the end, still haven't beaten it). Wish I had friends to play it with, would be way more fun (alas the game is not free). The UI and menus are pretty bad though, along with cringe AI use.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ The zombie mode is fun as hell.**  It kept a lot of what made it great in the first game it appeared in (don't change what works eh) but added lots of fun mechanics. As usual you start with your pistol but can buy guns off walls or try your luck at the mystery box. You can upgrade your gun's tier or feed it to the "Pack-a-punch" for a massive upgrade. Theres new perks and as you play more you unlock ways to customize each perk to your liking. The guns are fun, the zombie are dangerous, the maps are really cool. The first 2 maps have stories you can do solo. The second one in particuliar is quite crazy.<br/>
**++++ Varied main campaign missions.** For an FPS I was quite impressed. Some missions were actually open world with some objectives and optional content. Others were hitman-lite where you gather clues and intel with multiple ways to complete your goal. You also had the vehicle moments, base defense mission, and even a zombie mission.<br/>
**+++ Story was pretty good.** CoD in the past always had surprisingly good campaigns. While this doesn't beat out the old Modern Warfare games it stands on its own with a good story and characters (Even if I find the idea of an ever more secret blacker ops team existing kinda silly).<br/>
**+++ The multiplayer is exactly as expected.** Its fast, its fun, its arcade-y and nonsensical. It is action packed though and chasing killstreaks is still fun. Lots of different modes and playlists too.<br/>
**++ I love home bases.** In this campaign you go back to a home base with a few upgrades where you can talk to your team. Its nice. It even has a pretty cool puzzle in it.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- The UI and menu experience is abysmal.** The main menu is an abomination of different battle passes, game modes, events and even other games. Loading into the campaign closes your game and reboots it in campaign, but theres no way to just boot it in campaign from the start. Too many menus for customization as well.<br/>
**-- Performance issues.** Pre-loading shaders too like 5 hours, but somehow persisted even after I closed the game. Once it had finished the game ran well but before that the MP just was unplayable.<br/>
**-- Use of AI for art and voice.** Shame on you Activision.<br/>
**- Game is more fun with friends.** This is not a free game, I had no friends on the game.<br/>
