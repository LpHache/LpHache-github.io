**Deathloop** is a first person stealth shooter game (akin to Dishonored but with more guns) where you play as Colt. You are stuck on an island in an endless time loop except it seems you're able to remember things even if the day resets. You're one of the nine founding members (visionnaries) of this facility and you quickly realise you want to break this endless loop as there is no end in sight for it and that's no way to live. To do this you learn you need to kill all the founding members before the day resets to destabilize the loop. As such, you explore 4 distinct maps during 4 different time periods (morning, noon, afternoon, night) to uncover secrets and ways to kill each member in a single day. You can only explore one zone per time period, and time moves to the next period the moment you exit an area. So you have to plan out your day properly or risk having to redo it all. You get a nice variety of guns and powers stolen from other visionnaries. Throughout the game you have another visionnary, Julianna, who also keeps her memory and teases you and occasionaly also trying to kill you during your day. Game ends once you successfuly kill each member in a single day.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ Main characters are well done.** I really loved the MC and his voice actor. Lots of personality coming through with nice character growth as the game goes on. Julianna was done similarly well.<br/>
**++++ Maps are rewarding to explore.** Yes there are only 4 maps, but they have very different enemy layouts and opening depening on what time of day you come. A map in the morning won't play out the same way when you visit at night which makes revisits always fresh and interesting. They are also a good size to cross them pretty quickly when you know what you are doing while leaving room to explore a lot if that is you goal. Struck a nice balance there. There are also loads of hidden secrets if you have the patience and interest to uncover them. Some older version of me might have, but I held back the completionist this time around.<br/>
**+++ Time loops are neat.** Like with Outer Wilds, I just think its a neat concept that your main weapon is your knowledge and you could have finished it at any time.<br/>
**+++ The weapons support many playstyles and are fun.** Combat is important, and the weapons feel good to use. You can be nailing people in the head for steal or melting them with a laser beam. You could be going in guns blazing akimbo pistol with explosive headshots too. Fun for the whole family.<br/>
**++ I liked the powers.** Some were powers you commonly see in every game like stealth and teleport, but there were different cool ones like linking enemies and blinding them. Each also had two extra upgrades. Bit of a shame that most of the time the best course of action was just to nail headshot guys so I didn't end up using them much (except invisiblity).<br/>
**++ Cool multiplayer idea.** At any time you can decide to play as Julianna instead of Colt and go around invading other player's loops to ruin their day. Fun idea kind of like dark souls invading. I turned it off though cause once I "paused" to go pee and came back to all my lives lost cause I got invaded. I need my pauses.<br/>
**+/- The story is serviceable.** For most of the game, it was pretty good. Loved discovering about the island's past and the characters on it, but I found the ending really unsatisfying. I'm someone who likes answers, and there sure as hell were none there.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**-- The load times can be pretty long.** Even on my NVME SSD, it could take minutes to load a map. <br/>
**-- The AI is plain bad.** This was a common complaint of the game and it is very true. The enemies just aren't very interesting to fight at all. They simply rush your position and shoot you at near point blank range if they heard you or stay where they are and shoot. They dont have powers, they don't use items except a couple of grenades (rarely), and all have the same weapons as you. There's no real cover system either. Fighting them alone is basically trivial but the moment a large amount have noticed you you simply die because you have no defensive tools (shields or heals) and no real area attacks either. It makes going for the action road a real bummer since it feels like it wasn't designed for that.<br/>
**-- No enemy variety.** In conjunction with the previous point, it made combat fairly boring. The only difference were their weapons (and lets be honest difference betwen AR and shotgun was meaningless for enemies) and that the visionnaries had 1 power. But they died just as fast so its not like it made an interesting boss fight or anything. There was even a system where you can tag enemies and it displays their weapons, but also details like "aggressive, has good aim, persistent, etc" and it gets you thinking you can use this strategically but its just useless. Game could have used enemies with shields or with some armor and such.<br/>
**-- Lack of present day worldbuilding.** Honestly we learn a lot about the past, quite a bit on the name characters, but next to nothing on the world. I wish i knew more about the program, what they are building, why they care to save it.
