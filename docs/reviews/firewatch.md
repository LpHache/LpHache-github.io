Firewatch is a small narrative walking simulator game where you play as a guy going to a National Park to watch for fires (and has a lot of personal life issues). Youâ€™re constantly in contact with another woman (your boss), who works a nearby tower. You basically walk around the park chasing a few hooligans away and uncovering a weird mystery unfolding in the area.

**++++ The story was quite interesting.** Weird things keep happening around your tower making the characters get progressively more paranoid. People following you, weird objects scattered around, you get the idea. It's all very well done and nicely wrapped at the end. Enjoyable little mystery story and also very emotional.<br/>

**+++ The characters are well written.** For most of the game, you are talking to your manager in another tower and going back and forth on everything from current events in the game to personal backstories of the characters. They are well voiced, and the conversation flows nicely for the whole game with some dialogue choices as well.<br/>

**++ Simple relaxing gameplay.** It's a lot of walking and picking up stuff mostly, but it makes for a relaxing experience just wandering the wilderness and chatting with your boss
**++ Art style.** The game has a simple yet very beautiful art style that I enjoyed that made the world enjoyable to explore.<br/>

**-- A bit too much backtracking.** There's a few areas where I feel if they gave you an alternate route back instead of walking 5-10 mins through the same zones would have been much more engaging. I understand all that time was used for dialogue, but a change of scenery is always welcome.
