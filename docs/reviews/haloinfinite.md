Halo Infinite is the latest installment of the Halo series. You once again follow Master Chief after a sudden attack on a UNSC spaceship where he finds himself on a broken ring The Banished (brutes) are trying to repair. You make it your mission to rescue your crew and stop The Banished at all costs.

**++++ Great Halo combat.** This is another home run for great Halo gameplay. The weapons are fun and responsive, the fights are challenging, and you often get the usual suite of cool Halo vehicles to mow down your opponents with. The grappling hook to throw bombs and quickly reposition was great as well. Few other gadgets like shield wall, dash, and sensor kept things interesting too.<br/>
**++++ Sweet new weapons.** The Hydra (Explosive guided rounds) was a blast to use, commando (LMG) was fun as well as the Shock rifle (stuns) and Skewer (grunt sniper). They also added weapons variants for ALL weapons that modified their stats and use (Like a shorter range sniper with more ammo and a gap-closing Gravity hammer).<br/>
**+++ The open world wasn’t too bloated.** What I mean is that there weren’t dozens of pointless badly written sidequests in this game. Yes, there were Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) to capture a lot, but those were basically fast travel points and areas to spawn vehicles / the loadout you wanted. So they felt good to capture. The rest were all optional easy to do stuff like rescue spartans, find some cores (upgrade component for your skills), assassinate special grunt targets (to unlock their variant weapon) and a few bases to sabotage. Good little objectives that made sense to do and rewarded you all with points to unlocked better loadouts at FOBs. Also fully optional (missions are fast travel points too, don’t even need FOBs).<br/>
**+++ Decent story.** It isn’t really as grand or epic as other entries in the stories, but it's a lot more personal. You get a lot of character development about Chief as a human that I really liked as he explores his feelings a little deeper beyond what we usually see. The story of the banished is interesting as yell even if they do too many monologues.
**++ Good soundtrack and sound design. Halo soundtrack is always a banger, and continues this trend here. Where the main theme hits you can’t help but feel hyped. Of course they remix it a bit every time and it's not my favorite iteration, it's still good. Sound design of guns and enemies is always top notch as well. Grunt headshots, sniper sounds, vehicle sounds, all classics.<br/>
**--- It's a great FPS game with a Halo skin, but it’s not a good HALO campaign.** What I mean is that usually Halo campaigns are more well crafted. They are epic set pieces and each mission has a goal and you’re going to a bunch of different places. You have a certain sense of scale with the UNSC armies and all the leaders you talk to. You have the good intro missions, the stealth missions with snipers, the Scorpion tank mission where you blast through shit, the sick final where you take down a big bad or run away from explosions. That’s what makes a good Halo campaign. This game has none of that. The missions all happen in the same biome or within forerunner structures. Because of the open world, they just feel like bigger “take down this outpost” activities instead of proper missions. You also spend way too much time traversing the same 4 hallways for like half the game walking through the same interior structures forever. It's also a very lonely game. You only have the AI and 1 soldier you talk to for the whole game and that's it. While it helped with the chief's character, it was a bit bland.<br/>
**-- Singular location got old fast.** As mentioned above, the open world being a single biome got pretty boring. Same landscape the whole game, and even worse inside structures. Wish that it had been different.<br/>
**- A few notable omissions.** Any weapon on demand and they don’t include the spartan laser? C’mon man that’s the most fun one. Also no fuel rod launcher, and no enemy Scarab tanks to take down.
