Cocoon is a simple puzzle game where you play as a small insect creature. The puzzles revolve around round orbs you can carry around but also enter, as each orb is its own world you can explore.

**++++ Clever and fun puzzles.** The orb-worlds are so fun to play around with. You can dive into the orb you carry at fixed points and get more worlds. You can store worlds within each other to carry them all around.  It's a really unique system that I haven’t really seen before. Although it might seem confusing and complex at first, the game does a good job explaining exactly how everything works and leaving little room for error. I never got stuck more than a few minutes on any particular puzzle.<br/>
**++++ Beautiful art style and good animations.** The game just looks gorgeous and the worlds are all very distinct and pretty. The animations were natural and seamless, all the moving parts looked really well done.<br/>
**+++ Mysterious world and story.** While you won’t get much story in this game, the ending was very interesting, and the visual storytelling is great. It’s an interesting world for sure.<br/>

**++ Good soundtrack and sound design.** Just satisfying clicks and boops. Whimsical tunes.<br/>
**++ Neat little bosses.** Highlighted gameplay progression and were nice in breaking the pace of solving puzzles a bit. They weren’t very hard.<br/>
**++ Casual controls.** Only WASD needed and 1 action button. There's no fighting per se (outside of 4 bosses fights, which work with evading attacks and using the action button) and there are no puzzles that demand timing skills or weird series of commands.<br/>
**++ Perfect length.** Makes for a nice palate cleanser game. Sitting at 5h long, it’s just long enough to explore the orb mechanic nicely, and it's over before you can get tired of it.<br/>
**+ Easy to 100% if you don’t miss the collectibles in your run.** Check a guide or just pay a little attention in game and you shouldn’t have a problem with it.<br/>
**-- No backtracking.** This is actually good usually, as you can never enter a fail state and the game prevents you from going anywhere you shouldn't. But it also means if you miss a collectible, you’re never getting it unless you start over.
