Metroid Dread is a 2D action-adventure *Metroidvania* where you play as Samus, obviously, dropped on a random planet and getting her powers stolen by the local big bad. It has a very classic feel, very large maps with tons of secrets, bosses, enemies and the like. Its quite a fun action game and I'm happy I got to play it. There isn't much platforming (such as spike pits, spike wall, flying through tight spaces, etC) and focuses much more on combat and abilities to discover hidden areas.<br/>

**++++ Looks fantastic.** The game is gorgeous, easily its strongest point to me. The envrionments look very good and so do the enemies. Cutscenes are give or take but considering it's a Switch game theres only so much to do there.<br/>
**++++ Map design is so good.** Despite having 6 very large maps with hundreds of path, the game made sure the envrionments and configurations changed at every major point tonicely lead the player in the right direction. While some people enjoy the puzzle aspects of these types of games, where you have to search or remember which area was blocked that can now be opened, Dread is surprisingly linear. I appreciated that as getting lost and not knowing where to go is usually a big turn off for me.<br/>
**+++ Great progression with cool abilities.** Every time I picked up the game, I managed to find at least an upgrade for my suit within a session. Getting new rockets, new suit resists, new bombs, etc. These help change up the gameplay and always open up new paths to keep you going.<br/>
**++ Interesting boss battles.** The major bosses encountered really pushed me to make use of all the abilities I had so far and were nice challenges compared to the easily disposable mobs found around the map.<br/>
**++ Good map.** A good map is always essential in these types of games. Important to show what kind of obstacle blocks each path, secrets, markers, etc.<br/>
**++ Story was ok.** I know nothing of Metroid lore whatsoever so that probably didn't help. Otherwise its a pretty simple "escape the planet" scenario and figure out why the big bad wants with you. Serviceable.<br/>
**- Frustrating switch controls.** This is more to do with the Switch, and its not the first time I have issues with the control scheme (hello DBZ). A game like Metroid requires a lot of jumping and using multiple abilities to get to secrets or beat a boss and I found myself messing up often cause my fingers couldnt do the jump and hold another button for an attack while also shooting stuff all on one hand.<br/>
**- Reliance on counters / parry.** This is also a general gaming trend I'm not particularly fond of. I've never enjoyed parry mechanics. I hate that waiting for the enemy to make a move is the correct play instead of just proactively using my attacks and abilities. Dread has a few bosses you absolutely have to parry, it also insta kills any mob enemy. Theres also a frustrating one where they want to enemy to be scary to be chased by it cause they are invulnerable, but can be parried for a stun. Except the parry window is random every time with a particularly tiny window. Annoying.
