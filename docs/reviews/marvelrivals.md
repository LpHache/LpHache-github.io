**Marvel Rivals** is the latest competitive objective based hero shooter only this time it is based on Marvel IP heroes and villains. Fight other players on king of the hill or payload maps in 6v6 matches with characters split in Tank / Damage / healer roles. Straightforward premise.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
All things considered I like this game a lot. I can see msyelf playing it casually for quite some time. It plays really well and I enjoy a lot of the heroes. Just wish there were more maps. Would recommend.<br/>

#### **The Good**
**++++ The gameplay is fun and smooth.** The biggest takeaway is that the characters feel good to play. The abilties are interesting and are rewarding to use, movement feels good and the maps are well designed.<br/>
**+++ Visual design is cool.** The game has a good visual style that matches the comic book feel in my opinion. The characters and maps are very vibrant and flashy.<br/>
**+++ The menu is actually really nice.** I think they did a great job with the individual hero pages having their own intros, plus you can see all the cosmetics for the hero in one place (looking at you R6) as well as lore stories. The career page is also very clear. Only the battlepass page could use some improvements.<br/>
**++ Decent monetization.** Worth noting that all heroes are free to play from the get go which is always appreciated. The battlepass does include a nice free skin and it was pretty cheap to unlock it as well (5 USD). No other loot boxes or weird monetization.<br/>
**++Smooth launch.** I didn't have any major issues with bugs, crashes or performance during launch week at all. Pretty impressive.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- Tanks are a bit lacking.** Can't quite put my finger on why, but they don't feel as good to play as in Overwatch. Much ahrder to perform decently without constant heals.<br/>
Notes
**- The spread of heroes could have been better.** Twice as many DPS heroes as tanks or healers was a bit of an odd choice. Wish there were more of the other 2.<br/>
**- Not enough maps.** With only 4 different maps I feel like I play the same setting too often.<br/>
