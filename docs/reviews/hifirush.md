**Hi-Fi Rush** is a rythm hack'n'slash game where you play as Chai, a pretty normal guy wanting to get his lost arm replaced with a robotic prosthetic. The process goes wrong and he gets fused with his iPod. Now labelled a defect, he fights for his survival and to take down a megacorp while infused with the power of feeling the beat. In this game you fight enemies at the sound of the music to trigger combos with light and heavy attacks, while traversing a colorful corporate campus with classic platforming gameplay.<br/>

#### **Final Opinion**
I had a lot of fun with this game. I just really loved the cast of characters that they made for Chai's team and all their interactions were really great. The game also just oozes with styles from its soundtrack, to visual / level design, and boss fights. It can be a bit hard however at the end and require some amount of focus to stay on beat. Definitely recommend  this game.

#### **The Good**
**++++ The music slaps.** As expected with a rythm game (but not always garanteed), the music is great. It compliments the combat and boss fights perfectly, and it is very upbeat and fun.<br/>
**++++ The writing is actually good.** I loved the writing in this game, it toed the line between cringy trying-too-hard and quippy one-liners perfectly. The result is fun dialogue that lands well, but knows its limits.<br/>
**++++ Great team of NPC's.** This goes with the previous point a bit, but I loved the people that joined Chai's team. They had great personality and the good writing helped a lot.<br/>
**+++ Pretty unique world.** Hi-Fi rush has a very unique art style. It's close to Borderlands cell-shaded look but a lot more colorful and pop-y. Combine that with factories and busy construction sites that all move to the beat of the music and you've got yourself a visually stunning world to explore. It did however get pretty busy on screen at times though.
Notes<br/>
**+++ Combat is well executed.** It doesn't punish too hard for missing beats, but gives good rewards when you do. There are a lot of combos and playstyles you can go for to switch things up between levels. There are also team up abilities with the members of your team which are cool to execute.<br/>
**+++ Platforming is tight.** Game doesnt massively innovate in this area, but they designed the levels really well. Lots of fun traversal, small puzzles, different camera angles, and small jumping challenges. It was nice that exploring was pretty rewarding with items, without being much of an open world. Kind of like finding small secret areas.<br/>
**+++ Cool boss fights.** I was happy that the bosses weren't just bigger mobs. They all had unique challenges to themwith great set pieces and an even better soundtrack. Fun to fight.<br/>
**++ Good length.** I just love a good 15h game that delivers exactly on its premise and doesn't drag on.<br/>

#### **The Bad**
**- Hard to remember combos.** You get accumulate a lot of moves in this game, and its really hard to remember most of them during combat and resorting to light attack spam isn't as fun. It didn't help that any damage interrupted combos so in harder fights it was sometimes not even worth it to try the fun long combos.<br/>
**- Too much parrying for me.** Controversial opinion I know. I have my hangups with parrying and the last half of the game put a lot of emphasis on that mechanic.<br/>
**- Being on the beat can be hard.** I found I played short amounts of time because I was mentally drained after a level of trying to focus on staying on the beat.<br/>
