**Divinity Original Sin 2** is, as Simon put it, an epic high fantasy RPG played from a top-down, isometric perspective. The main systems of this game are exploration, choice, story, and turn-based tactical combat. The game is divided into four story acts all taking place in different locations with entirely new maps to chart out and explore. Now, there is a ton to go through with this game so Iâ€™ll try to stick to the important stuff and keep it short.
<br/>

As always, let's talk about **the great stuff** first. The combat in this game is really excellent. The magical and physical armor system combat with all the buffs, debuffs, status elements and various environmental hazards created by spells made each encounter wildly different. The hundreds of abilities available for combat also made it so you can win encounters in a myriad of ways (or lose because of bad strategic calls). Second amazing thing about this game is the classes. Each class has a ton of skill options to choose from that provide unique effects on the battlefields, and the option to dip into any other class skills easily makes for truly interesting characters to pilot with a fun toolbox for each encounter. Not to mention some of those skills were insanely fun to use and were pretty epic. Third is quests and explorations. Exploring in this game is extremely rewarding as you often find high level gear and unique items in the most remote locations. It also allows you to find alternate routes for quests which I found really cool. There were also often 1-2 secret passageways leading to enemy bases that allowed you to sneak in the base, or sneak past guards. Really felt like the game was letting you approach each encounter the way you wanted to. This led to quests being a lot more interesting, each having different outcomes on the paths you took coming in, as well as your dialogue choices over the course of the quest. Additionally the companions were all pretty interesting, I liked their stories more than the main quest, I just wish they were a bit more fleshed out. Finally, I thought the first 2 acts were super enjoyable to explore and delve deeper into the story and all the characters. Final additional note: The last boss fight of the game was super awesome and very challenging <br/>

Now for **the less enjoyable** parts. First and foremost in the whole inventory system. While the loot and equipment grind was fun, always finding and getting newer and better gear, the rest of the inventory was a pain. First, important story items and not always marked as such and are easily misplaced, sold, or otherwise lost. Second, crafting is completely wasted in this game. All the components are basically wasted and just hog up room and weight. This is because nothing you can craft ever comes close to being as good as anything you find by exploring or even simply buying. Crafting should reward players for investing into it and getting recipes but the game doesn't do that (and there are barely any recipes you can get). Lastly, I really wanted one of my characters to make good use of bombs, grenades, and traps, but those items scale so horribly they are basically useless in the second half of the game and it made me sad. I wish one of the classes supported it better. As for the story, I found it increasingly hard to keep track of once we reached acts 3 and 4. Gods are good, gods are bad, allies are now enemies, enemies are now allies, nothing matters except that one end scene of act 3 and the final few moments of act 4. I thought act 4 dragged on too much, I was ready for a good final streamlined act to lead in to the boss but it was just as open as previous acts. One last point is basic QOL features being locked behind mods, which in turn disable achievements. Simple things like running faster, everyone having the pet pal skill, and source regenerating during sleep made the game so much smoother, especially since source in general was constantly overcosted both in memory slots and how much was available in game.
 <br/><br/>

 **Overall**, I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a 9 /10 score. I believe it's a game with incredible depth from the characters to the quests to the class system and skills available. It starts off strong with immense maps providing multiple approaches to the world and also rewarding adventurous players with treasure for their exploration. The fights are well built, and the combat is fun and strategic. However, the game struggles to close up its story beats in an adequate manner leading to an awkward ending where everyone is evil. It also made the last 2 acts feel longer than they should have been. The inventory is also a huge mess paired with a crafting system that feels incomplete and does not scale well at all. Finally, the source system felt imbalanced with default source being barely available in game in conjunction with source skills requiring 2 or even 3 memory points each felt very frustrating. Super happy I played it though I had a blast with the spells and classes and having 4 unique builds to pilot every fight.
